The person may have asked you a few questions and explained how they wanted to hear your opinion as part of a survey. Is your mind still racing with speculation that they're scammers? The truth is, they are not a scam but a legitimate company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why do they call you? What are the chances of such calls being scams? And is there a way to stop receiving these types of calls?</p><h2 id=a-brief-overview-of-dynata>A Brief Overview of Dynata</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynata</a> is one of the world's leading providers of first-party data. The business started as e-Rewards Services in 1999 and has since acquired many companies and gone through several mergers over the last two decades. After its final merger in 2018, the company became Dynata.</p><p>Dynata is a research company whose primary goal is to help brands and companies understand their customers' behavior and reshape their business strategies based on the data collected. They conduct surveys to get opinions about products and services from the public and sell this information to their clients, so they can better understand the market.</p><h2 id=why-does-dynata-call-you>Why Does Dynata Call You?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Man-On-a-Phone-Call-While-Sitting-on-a-Chair.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a research company, Dynata calls you to invite you to participate in its research. The nature of the calls can vary greatly, from a specific survey about a product or a service to asking which candidate you will support in the next election. Nevertheless, you can rest assured that they won't try to sell you anything.</p><h3 id=does-dynata-pay-its-survey-participants>Does Dynata Pay Its Survey Participants?</h3><p>Upon checking Dynata's official website, we couldn't find any mention of rewards for participants who complete the surveys. Most of the recent reviews on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trustpilot</a> suggests that the survey promises rewards to surveyors, but they don't get them.</p><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trustpilot review</a> suggests that a person has received a gift card after completing the survey, but such reviews are hard to find. Even if the survey claims to reward you for completing it, there is no guarantee that you will receive anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-do-people-say-about-dynata>What Do People Say About Dynata?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dynata-Rating-on-Trustpilot.jpg><p>Although the company has a remarkable mission statement and credible clients such as Amazon, Spotify, and Nestle, its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trustpilot rating</a> is subpar. Reviewers have mostly complained about the following:</p><ul><li>Despite opting out of the survey, the company continues to contact respondents.</li><li>It takes a lot of time to complete the surveys, sometimes even more than an hour.</li><li>After-hours or late-night calls from the company.</li><li>Consistently getting calls, despite being on their no-contact list.</li></ul><p>After going through Trustpilot reviews, it is evident that people are unhappy with the company, and there are very few positive reviews. So, is it worth your time to complete the surveys?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-you-participate-in-dynata-surveys>Should You Participate in Dynata Surveys?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-of-someone-completing-a-survey-on-a-tablet.jpg><p>Although you are not obligated to participate in Dynata survey calls, they provide you with an opportunity to make a difference. They ask you about products and services, so if you have experience with those, you can share what you like and dislike.</p><p>In the future, brands may use your opinion and hundreds of other customers' opinions to reshape their brand strategy and improve their products accordingly. Your opinion indirectly helps you get better products and services, so you might feel you should take part in their surveys.</p><p>However, you shouldn't participate in the survey if you are being asked about a product or service you have never used; you have no knowledge of the topic you're being asked about; or you are asked something personal and feel you have to divulge something private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-calls-from-dynata-be-a-scam>Can Calls From Dynata Be a Scam?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/scam.jpg><p>Dynata is a reputable company with a decades-long history, so its legitimacy is undeniable. But, being a reputable brand that reaches hundreds of people daily allows scammers to scam people under the brand's name. It is, therefore, possible for scammers to contact you by claiming to be from Dynata.</p><p>How can you differentiate such calls? You can <a href=#>identify scam calls from scammers</a> based on the questions they ask. Here are some tips you can use:</p><ul><li>Dynata representatives will <strong>never ask you for personal information</strong>, such as your social security number, credit card details, or anything of that nature. Any time you are asked to provide extra personal or confidential information, be aware that this could be a scam.</li><li>While Dynata representatives <strong>won't force you to answer a question</strong> if you don't want to, scammers will try to extract information from you no matter what. Their words will sound forced and even beseeching.</li><li>Dynata representatives <strong>will not ask for remote access to your device</strong>. On the other hand, scammers may request remote access to your device to test a product live in front of you and later get your feedback. Avoid such scammers.</li><li><strong>Dynata does not sell anything to you</strong>. Beware if someone calls you claiming to represent Dynata and offers you a service or product to buy.</li><li><strong>Dynata doesn't charge you</strong> for taking the survey. When you're asked to pay a small fee to make your feedback count, it's a scam.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What should you do if you receive such a scam call? You should report it to the company so that they can take legal action against the scammers. To further confirm whether the caller was a scam, <a href=#>find out who they are with reverse phone lookup services</a>.</p><h2 id=how-can-you-stop-receiving-calls-from-dynata>How Can You Stop Receiving Calls From Dynata?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Man-Screaming-While-Attending-a-Phone-Call.jpg><p>Dynata allows you to opt out of their research if you are constantly annoyed by their calls or don't want to participate in their surveys. You have to let them know you don't like to be contacted, and your number will be added to their no-contact list. Residents in North America should call 1-833-757-1746, while those outside North America should call 1-801-341-0764.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dynata claims that once your contact information is placed there, you will no longer receive calls. However, according to customer reviews, the company does call people even after they opt out of the research. What if you still receive calls from Dynata after your phone number was put on their no-contact list?</p><p>If that is the case, you can contact them again and ask them to check whether your number has been added. Request them to do it if they have not already done so. If you continue to receive calls, <a href=#>block the number on your Android</a> or <a href=#>iOS device</a>.</p><h2 id=take-part-in-dynata-research-or-opt-out>Take Part in Dynata Research or Opt Out</h2><p>Getting a call from Dynata for the first time rings the alarm bells that they're trying to sell you something.
