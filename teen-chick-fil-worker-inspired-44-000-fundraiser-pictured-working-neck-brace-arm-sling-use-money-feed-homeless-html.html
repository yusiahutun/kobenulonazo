Like millions of others, he needed the money. And he needed it for a good reason: Christmas was coming and he and his family were planning to help feed the homeless.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Without Jakeem’s salary, someone might go without – and that certainly wasn’t part of the plan.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>So with his left arm strapped to his chest and his movements restricted by a neck brace, he was counting out change at the counter at the fast food restaurant in Avon, Indiana in early December when a customer listened to his inspirational story, took his photograph, posted it on Facebook and set up a fundraising page.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A target of $2,500 was set. Within 3 days, it had raised more than $5,000. Within five days, it was $12,000.

And it wasn’t until a few days after that that he and his parents were told about the fundraising page.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jakeem had been asked about his injuries by dozens of customers and thought nothing of telling them the truth – even embellishing the story for the entertainment of children.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He told DailyMail.com: ‘People would come in and be like, “OMG what happened?”</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘If they had little kids I would be like: “I fought a bear”, but if they were other adults I would tell them I was in a car accident but I am blessed to be alive.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>One customer went a step further and decided to do something to help: Cameron Nelson.</span></p><img id=i-35ff61d2f4423e4c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/09/15/3BFF31A800000578-4092898-image-a-1_1483976988537.jpg height=495 width=634 alt="Inspiring: Cameron Nelson listened to Jakeem's inspirational story, took his photograph, posted it on Facebook and set up a fundraising page.

We sneeze too hard & decide to call in, but he’s workin like nothing’s wrong.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘When I placed my order, I asked him what happened… he said he was involved in a car accident, but he was working cause he needs the money & also wants to feed the homeless for Christmas & needs the cash… maybe I was supposed to go in there. I think I may kick down a hundred or two on payday to help him out… he’s definitely doin it for a great cause & I was amazed he’s still workin despite his condition.’ (sic)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Nelson then linked to a gofundme fundraiser page for the teenager.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>So now that Jakeem knows he is more than $44,000 richer thanks to Nelson being so moved by his altruism? It’s certainly inspired him to think big, but not in the way one might expect.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/09/13/3BFD328A00000578-0-image-m-66_1483968190181.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Islamic school where pupils can't name the PM: All boys...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/09/13/3BFCB86E00000578-0-image-a-72_1483968011238.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Judge who called racist thug 'a bit of a c***' is cleared of...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/09/13/3BFD337600000578-0-image-m-9_1483968252429.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Theresa May warns mental ill health 'destroys lives' as she...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/01/09/13/3BFB150A00000578-0-image-m-64_1483968223610.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Fireworks boss blew up civil servant's home causing £15,000...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <span>1.9k</span> shares<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said: ‘I was amazed and I was so grateful.
