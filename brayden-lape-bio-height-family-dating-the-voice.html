Obviously, he had his name engraved on the Top 10 list of </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> right from the start.</span></p><p><span>This Brayden Lape Bio explores his life.</span></p><h3><b>Brayden Lape On The Voice</b></h3><p><span>Brayden Lape stepped in </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> auditions with “This Town” by Nial Horgan and received only one chair turn. But it was the chair turn he needed the most i.e. of judge Blake Shelton’s. Thereafter, he went on to sing Parker McCollum’s “Pretty Heart” for the battle round, Brett Young’s “Mercey”&nbsp; for the Knockout Rounds, Jordan Davis and Luke Bryan’s “Buy Dirt” for the top 16, Kenny Chesney’s “Come Over” for top 10, and Kane Brown’s “Homesick” for top 8.</span></p><p><span>According to the singer, “Homesick” was the perfect song choice for him that week. “This is a song I can kind of relate to, being out here all this time and missing home. This is a perfect song because I’m definitely missing my friends. Missing my family. I’m 16 and this is like, the longest I’ve been away from home,” he said at the time.</span></p><p><span>And the judges couldn’t agree more.“That chorus fit you like a glove,” said coach Gwen Stefani. While Blake added, “It is literally watching you developing vocally and artistically in front of our eyes,” Also, the judge was confident that Brayden was going to be way too big for them to ever get to come back on the show.</span></p><p><span>Joining Brayden for the top 10 of </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> were his co-contestants — Parijita Bastola (Team Legend), Rowan Grace (Team Blake), Justin Aaron (Team Gwen), Kim Cruse (Team Legend), Bryce Leatherwood (Team Blake), Kique (Team Gwen), Morgan Myles (Team Camila), <a href=#>Bodie</a> (Team Blake), and <a href=#>Omar Jose Cardona</a> (Team Legend).</span></p><h3><b>Brayden Lape Job</b></h3><p><span>Brayden Lape is a singer. But he was still a sophomore at</span><i><span> Grass Lake High School </span></i><span>located just east of Jackson when he appeared on </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> 2022. So, he was more focused on his studies than his professional career at the time.</span></p><p><span>However, with that being said, Brayden already had his first single on the way and was selling his mech (a mineral wash tee and hoodie) for $26 and $50 respectively.</span></p><p><span>So, how did he get into music? Well, it was all thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the lockdown, the singer taught himself how to play the guitar and started to sing a couple of cover songs. Soon, he was performing in smaller gigs and also writing his originals as well.</span></p><p><span>When Brayden isn’t singing, he is usually out on the field or the court. He loves playing football, basketball, and baseball. He was even the quarterback of his high school football team.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Brayden Lape?</b></h3><p><span>Brayden Lape was 16 years old in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He was one of the youngest contestants who appeared on </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> season 22.</span></p><h3><b>Brayden Lape Family</b></h3><p><span>Brayden Lape comes from a family of five.</span></p><p><span>His father, Bryan Lape is a Western Michigan University graduate who went on to work at </span><i><span>Ford Motor Company</span></i><span> for almost 15 years. Now, he is the Senior Supply Chain Lead at </span><i><span>Consumers Energy</span></i><span>. Like his son, Bryan is also a great outdoorsman who enjoyed hunting, ice skating, playing football, and more.</span></p><p><span>As for Brayden’s mother, Kari Lape was the one who encouraged Brayden to appear on&nbsp; </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Bryan and Kari were married back on May 30, 2004.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about Brayden’s siblings, he has a little brother and a sister named Boyer and Reesie.</span></p><p><span>Boyer turned 8 on May 22, 2022, while Reesie turned 14 on October 20, 2022.</span></p><p><span>“Happy 14th Birthday to our fierce and loving daughter!&nbsp; You are the most beautiful daughter I could ever ask for.&nbsp; I loved you as my little Reesie and love you more with every year that passes.&nbsp; I pray that 14 is one of your best.&nbsp; May God bless you and watch over you.&nbsp; Being your mom is an absolute blessing,” Reesie’s mother wished her a happy birthday on FB.</span></p><p><span>Also, Reesie and Boyer were in 8th and 3rd grade respectively in 2022. And like a good brother, Brayden often drove them to school.</span></p><h3><b>Brayden Lape Height</b></h3><p><span>Brayden Lape stands tall at a height of 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) and weighs around 72kg (160 lbs).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Brayden has blue eyes, amazing brown hair, and a long face.</span></p><h3><b>Is Brayden Lape Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Brayden Lape was dating Ava Viegelahn in 2022. The two are high school sweethearts who even attended their prom together. For the special day, Ava wore a blue dress while Brayden matched the color with his bow tie. However, they didn’t always coordinate their outfits.</span></p><p><span>According to Ava, she’s been his no.1 fan from the start. But on the other hand, Brayden didn’t hesitate to joke he was “single” time and again.</span></p><p><span>Find Ava on IG @</span><a href=#><span>avaviegelahn</span></a><span> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>AvaViegelahn</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> Brayden and Ava made their relationship IG official in Jan 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Brayden Lape From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Brayden hails from Michigan.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Brayden Lape Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Brayden receives his birthday wishes on August 4 and is of the Leo zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Brayden Lape On Instagram And Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>brayden_lape24</span></a><span> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>braydenlape24</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>Brayden_Lape24</span></a><span> and TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>brayden_lape24</span></a><span>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmm6qRrrGmuoylmKmdXZe2sHnHnqCgoKRis6K5yKWwZpyRqbavs4ytn55lpqS2pLGO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrayden-lape-bio-height-family-dating-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrayden-lape-bio-height-family-dating-the-voice.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrayden-lape-bio-height-family-dating-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrayden-lape-bio-height-family-dating-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrayden-lape-bio-height-family-dating-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrayden-lape-bio-height-family-dating-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./china-removes-qin-gang-foreign-minister-after-month-long-absence.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./china-removes-qin-gang-foreign-minister-after-month-long-absence.html>China removes Qin Gang as foreign minister after month-long absence</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eva-naturals-vitamin-c-serum-amazon-7484171.html>Amazon Shoppers Call This $15 Anti-Aging Serum Liquid Gold</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eva-naturals-vitamin-c-serum-amazon-7484171.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
