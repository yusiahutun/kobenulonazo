He became famous through his internet series Shane Dawson TV and in 2010 he won the title of the 25th most famous online celebrity according to Forbes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Shane Dawson Age and Early Life</strong></h2><p>Shane was born on July 19, 1988. She grew up in Long Beach, California, where he was born and attended Lakewood High School. His mother is Teresa Yaw and his father is Kyle Yaw Jr. They are of Swedish, Dutch, Welsh, and English descent. His childhood and adolescence were not exactly rosy for the YouTube star, as he was exposed to tyranny, mental and physical abuse at school by his father, who was an alcoholic and severely obese. His father later left the family, which caused the mother to make an effort to raise the children in their poor financial situation. The Youtube star developed a love for videos as a teenager and would even produce some video projects for his high school.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Anthony Scaramucci Family and His Grievances With Donald Trump</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Online Career</strong></h2><p>The young video enthusiast finally turned his love of video making into a business when he founded his YouTube channel ‘ShaneDawsonTV’ in March 2008. Since then, he has been constantly releasing new videos on his channel, including short web movies, music video comic versions, movie trailer comic versions, and original music to keep his avid fans interested. His most-watched video Fred is Dead is said to have been seen more than 24 million times.</p><p>After the success of his first channel, he soon launched a second channel called “ShaneDawsonTV2”, which was later named “Human Emoji” but was discontinued in 2012. He also launched a third YouTube channel called “Shane” to vlog five times a week and upload other posts. This YouTube sensation has worked with other YouTubers such as Joey Graceffa, BrittaniLouiseTaylor, TheFineBros, Trisha Paytas, iJustine, Tyler Oakley, Miranda Sings, Sawyer Hartman, Drew Monson, Liam Horne, Tana Mongeau, and others.</p><p>In August 2010, YouTuber created a 30-minute pilot project called SD High, funded by the Take180 Digital Media Group. The story in the pilot was about a teenager at school and his connection with other characters. The video was to be released on his main channel, but later he was commissioned by a television station to produce the pilot for their television channel. His attempt to produce the pilot failed, however, as he explained to his viewers in March 2011 via a video on YouTube.</p><p>The talented Internet personality launched a television show in January 2012, partly based on his journey to lose weight. That year he also produced a comic horror movie and in the same year released his first mainstream song Super Love, which was released on iTunes alongside the music video on his YouTube channel. Although the song was not a huge success, it topped the charts in Ireland at 87, the British indie charts at 16, the British singles charts at 163, and the US iTunes pop charts at 28. He also produced a second song this year called The Vacation Song, which was released in June 2012 with the accompanying video. Other songs he produced include Maybe This Christmas and Wanna Make Love To You.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tana Mongeau Bio, Height, Age, Family, Boyfriend, Personal Life, And Affairs</a></strong></p><p>In 2013 Shane started a podcast called Shane and Friends, which is still running today. That year he also expanded his weight loss video by teaming up with Sony Pictures Television for NBC to launch a project called Losin’ It. This is a 30-minute comedy series about a formerly obese person in a weight loss center who was to motivate new members to become counselors at the center and was appointed head of the center on his first day.</p><p>Shane also directed and starred in the film Not Cool in 2014, and although he was convicted by a film producer for not having the ability to produce a film, his film won the competition against another film entitled Hollidaysburg by Anna Martemucci, and he was awarded another film project to work on, with a $250,000 prize.</p><p>As a writer, Shane has written two memoirs entitled I Hate Myselfie and It Gets Worse Worst Worse, which is a collection of essays.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Shane Dawson Gay, Straight or Bisexual?</strong></h2><p>The sexual orientation of these YouTubers has been confused in public with speculation as to whether he is heterosexual or gay, as he was in a relationship with Lisa Schwartz before his current relationship with Ryland Adams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Shane Dawson Height and </strong><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>He has a comfortable height of 6 feet, which carries his now slimmer body of 79 kg very well.</p><p>The source of the YouTuber’s wealth is his online presence. He works with over 3 million followers on Facebook, more than 4.46 million followers on Twitter, and more than 5.1 million followers on Instagram. His net worth is approximately $4 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Brothers</strong></h2><p>Shane has two older brothers, Jerid Jaw and Jacob Yaw, who have been very close to the YouTuber since childhood and have always been very supportive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwKmtzZ5knZmnqLyvec2eq2avn6fBqXnBq6atoJWneqit2GaqraqRnrSpwIyoqWaamaiyucHApWSan5Vitaa1xqGraA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshane-dawson-net-worth-brother-gay-straight-or-bisexual-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshane-dawson-net-worth-brother-gay-straight-or-bisexual-age-height.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshane-dawson-net-worth-brother-gay-straight-or-bisexual-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshane-dawson-net-worth-brother-gay-straight-or-bisexual-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshane-dawson-net-worth-brother-gay-straight-or-bisexual-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshane-dawson-net-worth-brother-gay-straight-or-bisexual-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./courtney-miller-and-olivia-sui.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./courtney-miller-and-olivia-sui.html>Courtney Miller and Olivia Sui</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tree-hut-sugarlips-lip-balm-review-7563473.html>My Secret to a Permanently Hydrated Pout Is This $6 Lip Balm I Keep in Every Bag</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tree-hut-sugarlips-lip-balm-review-7563473.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
