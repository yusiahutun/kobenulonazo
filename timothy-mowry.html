He graduated from high school in Miami, Florida, where he met his wife, Darlene Lenny Flowers. He is a Caucasian and&nbsp; Irish ancestor, and his wife is a descendant of Afro Bahamian.</p><p>Like many American teenagers, he participated in various sporting events, including college football. The rigorous nature and discipline taught by his family stimulated his interest in the Army. His journey to the Army began with the choice of the Army team. He passed his physical and mental tests with flying colours.</p><p>During his tenure, he held the rank of First Sergeant (1SG), where he performed administrative tasks and led a battalion. The 1SG is also known as the “father of the unit” because the prosperity and development of the soldiers depend on the first sergeant.</p><p>After retiring from the U.S. Army, he moved to California, where he worked as a detention officer for the Glendale City&nbsp; Police Department. He enjoys retirement while his three kids are making their acting careers great.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Timothy-Mowry.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=timothy-john-mowry-s-family-life><span id=Family_Life><strong>Family Life</strong></span></h3><p>Tim married Darleen after several years of military service. They have four children together. Likewise, Tia and Tamera were born on July 6, 1978. Tamera is Tia’s Sister and only 2 minutes. Her parents moved to California to support her career in the entertainment industry. Darleen had his first career when he was in the Voice Group. Based on her Sister, the same duo of Tia and Tamera was seen in various television series and movies. They also had their television series Tia & Tamera from August 8, 2011, to September 22, 2013.</p><p>Tim and Darleen also have two sons, Taj (born May 17, 1986) and Tavia Mowry. Tahj Mowry is also an American actor who has appeared in television series such as Baby Daddy. But his younger brother, Tavior, has nothing to do with any entertainment appearances. He plays sports like his father and college football at the University of California, Davis.</p><p>Timothy is also the grandfather of two daughters, Cree, Aden, and Aria. Sister Morley described the family as “closely connected” and “deeply religious.” Tamera once said that she had been her virgin for 29 years since she was born as a Christian at eight. Tim lost his military discipline over their daughter and son. Tamera claims to discipline his son Aden.</p><p>Tahj even said in an interview that his father was his strength. He learned all the effort and patience from his father.&nbsp; Tim seems to be an ideal father.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=timothy-mowry-age><span id=Age><strong>Age</strong></span></h3><p>Timothy Mowry was born in the United States on January 4, 1957.
