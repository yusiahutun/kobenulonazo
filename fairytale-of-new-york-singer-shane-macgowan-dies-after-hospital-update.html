He then spent what is believed to be several months in intensive care during the summer this year.</p><p>During his fame with The Pogues, they released Fairytale of New York in 1987. It has since become a Christmas classic and fan favorite. It has been rated the best Christmas song for the past three years in a poll by Gold Radio listeners in the UK. The song featured Kirsty MacColl who died tragically in 2000.</p><p>In 2011, it was claimed that it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was the most-played Christmas hit of the 21st century</a>, and yet the single has never been number one in the UK. It was kept off the top of the charts by Pet Shop Boys‚Äô cover of <a href=#>Elvis‚Äô</a> Always on My Mind upon its original release in 1987 and was stuck at the number two spot.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Britney Spears ‚Äòthrows shade‚Äô at her family by saying her brother is ‚Äòlike a dad‚Äô figure</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-losing-the-love-of-my-life>Losing the ‚Äòlove of my life‚Äô</h2><p>His wife, Victoria, 57, called him the ‚Äúlove of my life.‚Äù</p><p>Sharing a black and white photo of Shane to her <a href=#>Instagram</a>, she penned: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to say this so I am just going to say it.

The really, really big challenge that we all face is to go beyond what our minds think are the limits of love and what love really is.</p><p>‚ÄúA lot of the time that thing we call love can more accurately be described as attachment or desire or need or longing or closeness or connection. And all of these are totally valuable and human and we need to acknowledge and appreciate and accept every part of our experience.</p><p>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt imagine life without this person that you love.‚Äù</p><p>She concluded: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in these moments when you are staring into the abyss that you have an opportunity to expand your consciousness beyond the limitations of your mind. You have an opportunity to discover more of who you really are and more of who your soul really is and more of your connection with this person who you love.‚Äù</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Priest is fired after singer Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs steamy music video inside church</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2h9cLLAoqmyrJGhsm67xWalnq9drryzt4ysoKeflad6tLTAp5xmpZGYtLDDwKdknaGVqHqistOeqWagn6i9qsDApWSuqJSWwaZ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffairytale-of-new-york-singer-shane-macgowan-dies-after-hospital-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffairytale-of-new-york-singer-shane-macgowan-dies-after-hospital-update.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffairytale-of-new-york-singer-shane-macgowan-dies-after-hospital-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffairytale-of-new-york-singer-shane-macgowan-dies-after-hospital-update.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffairytale-of-new-york-singer-shane-macgowan-dies-after-hospital-update.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffairytale-of-new-york-singer-shane-macgowan-dies-after-hospital-update.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sharon-stone-66-showcases-age-defying-figure-in-a-glowing-black-sequined-dress-at-49th-chaplin-award-gala.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sharon-stone-66-showcases-age-defying-figure-in-a-glowing-black-sequined-dress-at-49th-chaplin-award-gala.html>Sharon Stone, 66, showcases age-defying figure in a glowing black sequined dress at 49th Chaplin Awa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aven-jones-cheat-kylee-russell-know-html.html>Did Aven Jones Cheat on Kylee Russell?
