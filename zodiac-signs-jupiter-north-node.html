<time>02 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Jupiter is traveling with the North Node of Destiny this year from May 16 to July 17, 2023, so get ready for two months of Taurean delight. Jupiter and the North Node both push towards </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> of whatever they’re about. In Taurus, this can be connection with nature, sweetness and joy, as well as beauty and sensual values. Sensuality can be food or nice fabrics, not just</span><span> sexy fun! Taurus is the fertile garden of the zodiac so it’s gonna get juicy</span><span>. We’re gonna talk big picture first, then get into <a href=#>how Jupiter conjunct the North Node will affect each zodiac sign</a>.</span></p><p><span>A couple good examples of this we’ve seen in pop culture already are Janelle Monae’s new single and Timotheé Chalamet’s Willy Wonka remake. Monae’s new single is all about Taurean abundance—slow, sapphic indulgence, with a </span><span>richly</span><span> sexy music video. Chalamet’s Wonka is planned to be a <a href=#>more innocent and childlike version</a>, full of sweetness and joy, standing in opposition to the dark, sarcastic tone of the 1970s original—which came out during Jupiter in Scorpio, the opposite sign from Taurus!</span></p><p><span>Jupiter is the planet of <a href=#>wisdom, good fortune and expansion</a>. Think Santa Claus meets Merlin—bringing presents but also sage advice. Jupiter crowns and exalts what it touches, like the advisor to a king. Nature is being seen as more important and the movement to replace lawns with gardens is becoming more prominent, as well as mainstream use of plant medicine get even bigger. We are also seeing more and more people make rest and leisure a greater priority in their lives as well as things like “slow-maxxing.” Owning one’s deepest desires is also part of this story. None of this is brand new but we’re gonna watch it grow even more while Jupiter is in Taurus, especially while he’s with the North Node.</span></p><p><span>In evolutionary astrology, the North Node is <a href=#>considered a point of destiny</a> and fruitful life direction; the compass pointing where to grow. In <a href=#>Vedic astrology</a>, it’s known as Rahu and considered a point of excess and overdoing, so the Taurean indulgence has a risk of going too far here. A triple-chocolate fudge cake is amazing, but if you eat the whole thing in one sitting it’ll make you sick.</span></p><p><span>It’s our hope that more body positivity will come out of this—Taurus is all about <a href=#>the relationship with one’s body</a>, and that relationship can get very complicated in a culture where some bodies are idealized and others seen as shameful. This isn’t just to do with size, but color, gender, gender expression and age. It’s our hope that this time will show us a watershed moment for seeing things around body positivity and self-love continue to change for the better. After Jupiter officially joins forces with the North Node on June 1, 2023, you’ll feel these themes become even more prominent in your life and our world at large.</span></p><p><span>Let’s talk about what it means for you, according to your <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and if you don’t know <a href=#>know your birth time</a>, your <a href=#>sun sign)</a>:</span></p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3564266180492><h2>Aries & Aries Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>The North Node & Jupiter reunion takes place in your 2nd house of finances, resources and values. This can easily mean making more money or otherwise becoming better resourced. Since Jupiter rules your 9th house of higher education, foreign travel, spirituality, and divination, any of these topics can be roads through which more money can come your way. Jupiter ruling your 12th house can mean that time spent alone is key right now for sparking insight into how to get what you want. Your beliefs about money – your “money mindset” – may be a big focus here, providing keys to unlock growth. This is a time of great potential for becoming better resourced – but that may mean journeying far from home to make it happen, physically or spiritually. Your ability to receive is stored in the body, so get in touch with your physical self to up that baseline. Taurus is a very fertile sign, a garden of earthy delights, and the juiciest fruit is grown slowly from a well-plowed field. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9396628216504><h2>Taurus & Taurus Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>The union between Jupiter and the North Node is happening in your first house, which is all about YOU and how you’re seen by others. The first house has a lot to do with the body so this can be a time for experimenting with a makeover or a brand new look. Because Jupiter rules your 8th house, insecurities and fears can come up as part of this process. But that also means it’s the perfect time to fall in love with yourself in ways you never thought possible. Jupiter also rules your 11th house of social networks so this is a great time to discover all the people who love you even more when you show up as your authentic self. You’ll likely discover that the more you walk around feeling yourself, that confidence attracts opportunities and good luck, which is what Jupiter is all about! This is your reemergence into the world as a powerhouse unafraid to take up space and own it. Part of this process is caring for your body—massage, acupunctur&nbsp; or just going to sleep on time. Love on your sacred vessel. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8912579957356><h2>Gemini & Gemini Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>This transit is taking place in your 12th house of retreat and mental health. It’s asking you to take greater time for yourself. To focus on winding down and slowing down. We know how hard that can be, believe us, but rest and alone time are crucial for you right now. This focus not only helps you, but it also improves your one-on-one relationships and your career. In terms of career, a shift to work-from-home may be key for you, or shifting your work-life balance in other ways than knocking out the commute. Sometimes solitude is crucial for romantic partnerships, because exploring your needs and desires on your own can lead to breakthroughs in your relationship, stuck places coming unstuck. A break from work can be important in the same way; it might be just what you need to open the path forward towards your dreams. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3706677937447><h2>Cancer & Cancer Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>Friendships and networking will be of key focus for you while this energy is manifesting through your 11th house, as well as your dreams and aspirations. Sitting with what you want to make happen in your life, and beginning the habits and routines that will get you there is the calling for you at this time. Jupiter rules your 6th house of habits and routines, but also your 9th house of beliefs and values, which means you may feel inspired to move toward goals that reflect what really matters to you. A long-distance trip is possible here, especially if it’s for work. Let exposure to new and different ideas and/or places inspire you. Have an adventure! If you’ve been needing to make a decision around social media, this is the time. Meeting new and interesting people is likely, especially if you explore somewhere you’ve never been before. It’s not necessarily about meeting your new bff but networking with a broader group. These may be more professional connections than social, but you never know until you try. So go out, enjoy life, and talk to strangers! <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9330049261084><h2>Leo & Leo Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>This point of connection is taking place in your 10th house of reputation, visibility and career. You may find yourself becoming more popular and attracting greater fortune in your life via your career and being seen. How Leo of you! This may be through creative pursuits as well as shared resources. You may be coming into money or figuring out a financial deal with a partner. Deeper questions of why are likely to come up for you with what you do for a living and what your big goals are. Sit with them, maybe figure them out through art or talk to your therapist about it. This summer will have even more of all eyes on you, so don’t overdo the hot babe summer you have coming, and take this time to solidify your status and get comfy in a spotlight you might not be used to the heat of just yet. It’s a good thing! The heat of the spotlight can be a lot to deal with, but you’re royalty.

It’s a GREAT time to take a vacation way away from everyone and into nature, or somewhere you can just indulge and have fun. It’s also a wonderful time to connect with nature, plants, animals or your own body on a deeper spiritual level. Because Jupiter rules your 4th house of home, bringing more nature into your house by sprucing up the garden or just hanging a porthos in your bedroom can make a world of difference for your well-being. And because it also rules your 7th house of close partners, it’s a really great time to do any of this with your spouse or bestie. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4121900826446><h2>Libra & Libra Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>Jupiter meets up with the North Node in your 8th house, which governs shared resources, transformation and taboo. It’s a great time to dip your toes into pursuing long-held secret desires. Anything exciting and a little scary (sexually or otherwise). This is a fruitful time for any deep inner-healing work you’re doing. It’s a time to shed old baggage and any internalized projections of what other people want. Jupiter rules your 3rd house of writing and 6th house of daily habits, so a journaling practice might be a big help here, since the 8th house tends to hide from us. Partners—romantic or otherwise—may receive a windfall, especially ones you share finances with! It’s a great time to clean out less metaphorical dark hidden spots as well. There can be treasure hidden in the attic that you haven’t touched in years, why not go spelunking? <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8705994291151><h2>Scorpio & Scorpio Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Your 7th house of partners (romantic, business or otherwise) is hosting this connection between Jupiter and the North Node, so much of what we say may show up in their lives more than yours! This is a great time to liven up your meaningful relationships, so talk with them about how you can bring more fun and what desires you’d like to explore. Don’t just think dirty here; people you have a client relationship with are 7th house as well, and since Jupiter rules your 2nd house of money this is a great time for any of you freelancers to get paid what you’re worth! Or to commission an artist or creative for something new and different, since Jupiter also rules your 5th house of art, creativity, fun and play. Fun with your crush is on the table here too of course, because it’s a great time to try something new and different with a romantic partner. Like a restaurant that just opened up, try that new hole in the wall together! <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>Sagittarius & Sagittarius Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>Jupiter and Rahu (aka the North Node) conjoin in the part of your chart to do with health, routines and daily life, plus pets and jobs. This is a great opportunity to get off your butt about that health habit you’ve been meaning to build, whether it’s diet, pumping iron, or just getting out of the house more. It’s about what your body needs (and your body’s needs might not be what you expect)! Figure out what works for you and make it fun. You’ll likely realize how much beauty and joy are key to your vitality and well being, as well as any gigs or job opportunities that come up. Changes may also happen in family and household relationships, since you’re more focused on taking care of the day-to-day. If you’ve been thinking about adopting a new furry friend, one might fall in your lap during this transit. If you already have a pet and it isn’t spayed, you might even have kittens or puppies to look forward to. Any time there’s 6th house action life gets busier, so look forward to being more active and engaged!</p><p>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3663755458515><h2>Capricorn & Capricorn Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Capricorn.png><p>This meeting of Jupiter and the North Node is taking place in your 5th house of hobbies, leisure, children, and good times. This can mean more of a focus on what brings you joy, encouraging you to explore these facets of yourself more deeply. This could mean returning to activities you used to do as a child. Pregnancy is a major possibility as well—if you’re looking forward to that, awesome! Otherwise, use protection. Sometimes giving yourself permission to let your hair down can be hard for you, Capricorn. Jupiter rules your 12th house of self-undoing and seclusion, so unconscious fears that get in the way of you enjoying life may come to the surface. But the surface is where you can deal with them! The 5th house also rules arts and creativity, so this is a uniquely good time for you to channel your inner demons that way. Jupiter also rules your 3rd house of education but also of short trips and the neighborhood. A new class on something creative would be great for you, so find out what’s happening around you! <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9313131313131><h2>Aquarius & Aquarius Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aquarius.png><p>This union of Jupiter and the North Node takes place in your 4th house of family, home and roots. This period grants you the opportunity to beautify your home in a way that speaks to your soul; to make your house a home. This can be anything from renovation and expansion, moving to a bigger space or a radically different location, or simply making it more of a cozy cocoon. You may find that family get-togethers are particularly festive, especially ones that expand the definition of family. There’s a good chance that someone in your family gets a raise, and you’ll likely receive a nice gift when they do. This is also a fertile time for finding out more about your roots – where you came from and who your ancestors were. You may be surprised by how much learning about your roots helps inform what’s meaningful and valuable to you in a way that enriches your life. <a href=#>Read your full 2023 horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.8307053941909><h2>Pisces & Pisces Rising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pisces.png><p>Jupiter meets up with the North Node in your 3rd house of best friends/siblings, local area, communication and commutes. These things may become emphasized at work since Jupiter rules your 10th house of career. If you haven’t seen your siblings in person for a while, this may be when they finally visit. This is a great time for starting new projects or hobbies that involve writing or communication, such as reading more books, listening to more podcasts, or even starting your own. Taking a class in something embodied is great too; think gardening, pottery, yoga, etc. Or simply letting yourself be more physical when you learn—doodle during the lecture if it helps! If your email inbox has gotten out of hand, this is the time to handle it before it overflows. If you’ve been feeling boxed in, the medicine here is to get on your feet or wheels and go on an adventure, especially one with friends. Take time to explore the parks around you and get to know the local flora and fauna, mixing in technology with nature by using identifier apps to learn more about them.
