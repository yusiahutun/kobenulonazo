<time>13 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Diana, the People’s Princess, tragically died in 1997 in a car crash in Paris. The tragedy caused shockwaves around the world, where the tremors are still felt almost 30 years later. Many royal fans still remember the incredible kindness and compassion the mom-of-two showed to all people she met throughout her life. Now, a TikTok artist has drawn Princess Diana if she were still alive today and born in a different decade.</strong></p><p>The late Princess of Wales – the title now held by <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> – was the first wife of the then Prince Charles. The two went on to have children, <a href=#>Prince William</a> and Harry. Outside the realm of royal life, she became an international icon, from her beloved activism to incredible style. <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s popularity when she was alive was unmatched. Whether she was meeting a Head of State from another country or raising <a href=#>awareness for landmines in Bosnia</a>, she tackled each moment with dignity and neutrality. In 2021, a statue for the People’s Princess was unveiled in the Sunken Garden in Kensington Palace to pay tribute to her life and work. It was commissioned by her sons William and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tiktok-artist-imagines-princess-diana-if-she-was-alive-in-a-different-generation>TikTok artist imagines Princess Diana if she was alive in a different generation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-157130213-577x1024.jpg><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> star Jose_aart has imagined the princess if Diana was not only still alive, but if she was born in the current generation – decades after she actually was.</p><p>He takes a digital photo of the <a href=#>royal</a>, first adjusting her nose, which may have changed through genes if she was born later on. Then he changes her eyebrows, fills them out and makes them longer to match the current beauty trends.</p><p>After, Jose whitens her teeth – to follow standards that most popular culture strive to achieve, especially in the celebrity world – and moves on to change her hair.</p><p>Princess Diana’s iconic crop was her signature style. She rarely strayed from her short bob throughout her years in The Firm. Although hairstyles change within <a href=#>fashion</a>, she would instead style it differently to match current trends, from gentle waves and natural looks to a short crop she kept after divorcing the now <a href=#>King Charles</a>. Jose makes her hair longer, but keeps it blonde to stay true to the beloved royal. He also imagines it would be more natural, not super straight or a curled design.</p><p>After, he increases the size of her lips (I guess this would be lip fillers in this day and age). The TikToker then chooses a black number for the late star to wear – which is in true Princess Diana style, lest not forget the iconic revenge dress.</p><p>The final result is striking, it’s hard to imagine what Princess Diana would look like if she were still alive, but it’s a close call. If she was born later on in life, similar or younger age to her sons in an alternative universe, then it could be a decent impression on who she would be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royal-fans-say-the-finished-result-looks-like-diana-s-real-niece>Royal fans say the finished result looks like Diana’s real niece</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-52117839-688x1024.jpg><p>Fans rushed to the comments to rate the artist’s work. Some believed the finished result resembled Australian actress Delta Goodrem, but others were divided and felt instead, it looked similar to Diana’s real niece, Lady Kitty Spencer.</p><p>Kitty is the eldest child of Charles Spencer, 9th Early Spencer, and brother to Diana. Last year, he shared a <a href=#>rare childhood photo of Diana</a> in a moving tribute. She is also first cousin to William and Harry.</p><p>One fan wrote: “Ummm is that Lady Kitty Spencer at the end?</p><p>Another said: “She looks like Princess Charlotte.”</p><p>“So Kitty Spencer? lol,” a third echoed.</p><p>“I think she’d have short hair”, expressed a fourth.</p><p>Although a lot of commenters weren’t happy with the artist adjusting natural features of the princess, say her nose, lips and hair as it implied she would have had plastic surgery if she was alive in a different decade, which is just speculation. Princess Diana didn’t go under the knife when she was alive, so it wouldn’t mean she would do the same decades later.</p><p>A person argued: “I agree with her style would be different, but they had nose jobs in the 1980s, maybe a version where she doesn’t necessarily have to have plastic surgery”.</p><p>But someone else agreed: “Lips, nose, brows, hair. Exactly what everyone does now”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aGcK3RraCsrF2Zv6LD0manq6GemLK0v4ydoJqmkWK2p3nSoZxmr5Wnsm6%2F06KjpWWRoba3sYytpp2ZqWKvtsCMn5inq12hsqfAjJ2gr6GUmrFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fartist-draws-princess-diana-if-she-were-still-alive-today-but-fans-left-divided.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fartist-draws-princess-diana-if-she-were-still-alive-today-but-fans-left-divided.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fartist-draws-princess-diana-if-she-were-still-alive-today-but-fans-left-divided.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fartist-draws-princess-diana-if-she-were-still-alive-today-but-fans-left-divided.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fartist-draws-princess-diana-if-she-were-still-alive-today-but-fans-left-divided.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fartist-draws-princess-diana-if-she-were-still-alive-today-but-fans-left-divided.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carrie-underwood-joins-husband-mike-fisher-to-send-emotional-plea.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carrie-underwood-joins-husband-mike-fisher-to-send-emotional-plea.html>Carrie Underwood joins husband Mike Fisher to send emotional Easter weekend plea</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-exfoliators-for-bikini-area-1227354.html>6 Best Exfoliators for Bikini Area to Rock Your Swimwear</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-exfoliators-for-bikini-area-1227354.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
