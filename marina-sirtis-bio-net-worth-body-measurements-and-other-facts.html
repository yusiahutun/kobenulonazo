She is the half-human, half-Betazoid figure who was also the advisor on the Enterprise-D ship, where she worked as a close ally of ship’s captain Jean-Luc Picard. This mind-reading, telepathic, humanoid role was brilliantly played by the British-born American actress Marina Sirtis.</p><p>Sirtis, who has appeared in more television shows than films, has starred in all Star Trek series, and this is the role for which she is best known today. Here is a detailed insight into the life and affairs of the actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Marina Sirtis Bio</strong></h2><p>Marina Sirtis parents John and Despina Sirtis welcomed her when she was delivered on March 29, 1955, in a London hospital in Hackney, London. She was born in a bourgeois home and to parents who belonged to the working class. Although born in Inner London, Marina Sirtis grew up with her younger brother Steve Sirtis in North London (more precisely in Harringay County).</p><p>As a young girl, she began to take an interest in the performing arts and while attending secondary school in Tottenham, she looked for opportunities to realize her dream of becoming an actress. This prompted her to take the very courageous step of secretly auditioning for admission to an acting academy – the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She performed well at these auditions and was accepted to study at the institution.</p><p>The now determined and vivacious aspiring actress joined a drama group after graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1976. At the beginning of her acting career, she worked with the Connaught Theatre in West Sussex, England, but moved to the United States much later – in 1986.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Michael Blackson Wife, Kids, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Real Name, Bio</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Marina Sirtis’ first acting attempt was in 1976 when she worked with the Connaught Theatre. The theater was then directed by Nic Young, and she made her debut in a stage play by English playwright Joe Orton entitled What the Butler Saw. This was followed by a role as Ophelia in the play Hamlet. She made her film debut in 1983 in the film The Wicked Lady and then Blind Date (1984), where she was cast as a prostitute who died at the hands of a madman, and Death Wish 3 (1985) followed in rapid succession.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that before Marina Sirtis got her first movie role, she had made progress on the small screen, where she got her first credit in a series called Raffles in 1977 before she had another appearance in Who Pays the Ferryman that same year. The following year she was given a guest role that matched her ancestry when she played the role of Melina Stassinopolus in Hazell (1978).</p><p>After 10 years in the English film industry at the age of 31, Marina Sirtis decided to emigrate to the United States to seek new challenges and perhaps give her career a much-needed boost. So she came to the United States on a six-month visa, and this decision proved to be the best for her career, as her first project in the country’s film industry, Hollywood was Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987.</p><p>After she auditioned for a role (not the one Deanna Troi eventually played in the series), she went home and waited and expected a callback, which apparently never came. But just as she was packing up her things to return to the UK when her visa expired, Sirtis received by divine providence a callback from executive producer Gene Roddenberry and was offered the role of Deanna Troi.</p><p>Marina Sirtis’ has appeared in other films and series, including Heaven, Help Us (1994), Gadgetman (1996), Diagnosis: Murder (1998), Stargate SG-1 (2000), Threat Matrix (2003), Grendel (2007), NCIS (2013), My Summer Prince (2016), among others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>With a career spanning almost four decades, spanning the film industry in the US and UK, and having played on stage as well as on small and big screens, Marina Sirtis has become a voice in Hollywood.</p><p>She has also achieved enormous success with her numerous films and TV shows in which she has played the leading role. Her success has also been measured in financial terms, and her net worth has been put at $6 million, an amount that is equal to her efforts to date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Body Measurements – Height, Weight</strong></h2><p>The age of Marina Sirtis cannot be guessed due to her physical appearance. The evergreen actress, who has been around the world for several decades, still has a look that would put several young ladies in the shade. The 1.75-meter tall actress has done a great job in keeping her hourglass figure fit and attractive over time and holds a weight of 130 pounds (59 kg). Her chest-hip-waist-hip combination is measured at 37-27-36 inches and her bra/cup size is 34C.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Miles Davis Children, Wife, Biography, Net Worth, Death</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Other Facts About&nbsp;Marina Sirtis</strong></h2><p>Marina Sirtis is married to the rock guitarist Michael Lamper. They were introduced by a mutual friend, Anna, and the lovebirds were married in 1992 at a traditional Greek wedding ceremony.</p><p>Subsequently, she appeared in all seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation, including other reprises such as Star Trek: Generation, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek Insurrection, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek Nemesis, and Star Trek: Enterprise in 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999-2000, 2002 and 2005.</p><p>Marina Sirtis dared to act against the will of her parents when she took acting lessons in the back of her parents, but in the end, everything turned out well.</p><p>While attending school in Tottenham, Sirtis fell in love with the London club Tottenham Hotspur and even had the club’s logo tattooed on her back.</p><p>She is a Veganerin and also stands up for animal rights.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqK%2ByKeYZquZp8Gqv4yboKhlnprBbsPOq6uhZZKksbp5zJ6YrK2imrqmutOsZJqmlGK8tbTEq2SfmZOpwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarina-sirtis-bio-net-worth-body-measurements-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarina-sirtis-bio-net-worth-body-measurements-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarina-sirtis-bio-net-worth-body-measurements-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarina-sirtis-bio-net-worth-body-measurements-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarina-sirtis-bio-net-worth-body-measurements-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarina-sirtis-bio-net-worth-body-measurements-and-other-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meaning-of-wherever-i-may-roam-by-metallica.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meaning-of-wherever-i-may-roam-by-metallica.html>Meaning of Wherever I May Roam by Metallica</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./leslie-grossman-mourns-death-of-legend-father-marshall-grossman-8347966.html>Leslie Grossman Mourns Death of 'Legend' Father Marshall Grossman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./leslie-grossman-mourns-death-of-legend-father-marshall-grossman-8347966.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
