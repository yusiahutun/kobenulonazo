My body is more like a pawnshop. There’s a lot of interesting things put together, and if you look closely you’d probably be excited, but at first glance, not so much.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jessica-simpson-2006>Jessica Simpson (2006)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-mayer-jessica-simpson.jpg><p>John Mayer dated Jessica Simpson in 2006 after her highly publicized divorce from Nick Lachey.

I don’t think there’s a need for an apology. I feel like people end up finding their way to let you know they’re sorry. And [Mayer] might not be sorry, and that’s okay. We were kind of, like, on-off, on-off at that time. But to talk about anybody sexually was kind of disrespectful, but that’s on him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=minka-kelly-2007-2008>Minka Kelly (2007-2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-mayer-minka-kelly.jpg><p>John Mayer briefly dated Minka Kelly from the fall of 2007 to early 2008. The split was amicable and Minka was shown being supportive of her ex by going to his concerts. “Minka told a couple friends that she and John had broken up but she really didn’t want to tell anyone,” a source told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/celebrity/john-mayer-and-minka-kelly-quietly-split/>People</a> at the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jennifer-aniston-2009-2010>Jennifer Aniston (2009 – 2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-84982651.jpg><p>John Mayer dated Jennifer Aniston from 2009 to 2010. After the relationship with the Friends star ended, he talked about the relationship with Playboy in 2010. “That woman was the most communicative, sweetest, kindest person. When people hear the record [Battle Studies], I hope the songs make them think about their lives, not my life. Like, when you listen to Coldplay, do you think about Gwyneth Paltrow? I don’t write songs in order to stick it to my exes. I don’t release underground dis tracks.”</p><p>He continued, “We just have a regard for each other’s feelings that is pretty intense. It’s been a deep relationship, and it’s no longer taking place at all. Have you ever loved somebody, loved her completely, but had to end the relationship for life reasons?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=taylor-swift-2010>Taylor Swift (2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-john-mayer.jpg><p>Arguably one of the most famous relationships among millennial/Gen Z-ers, John Mayer’s relationship with <a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a> still affects Swifties to this day. They struck up a romance when the collaborated on his song “Half of My Heart.”</p><p>After their breakup, fans theorized that “Dear John” off her album Speak Now was based of the relationship. When the song initially came out, Mayer told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/john-mayer-taylor-swifts-dear-john-song-humiliated-me-107169/>Rolling Stone</a> in 2012, “It made me feel terrible, because I didn’t deserve it. I’m pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.”</p><p>“I never got an e-mail. I never got a phone call,” he recalled about how he figured out the subject of the song. “I was really caught off-guard, and it really humiliated me at a time when I’d already been dressed down. I mean, how would you feel if, at the lowest you’ve ever been, someone kicked you even lower?” When asked about the song’s line, “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” Mayer says, “I don’t want to go into that.”</p><p>“I will say as a songwriter that I think it’s kind of <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1607200/joe-alwyn-taylor-swift-matty-healy-breakup/ rel="noreferrer noopener">cheap songwriting</a>,” he says. “I know she’s the biggest thing in the world, and I’m not trying to sink anybody’s ship, but I think it’s abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, ‘Wait till he gets a load of this!’ That’s bullshit.”</p><p>In response to his reaction, Taylor Swift told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swifts-november-glamour>Glamour,</a> “How presumptuous! I never disclose who my songs are about,” and added that she did not want to hear his public response. “I know it wasn’t good, so I don’t want to know. I put a high priority on staying happy, and I know what I can’t handle.”</p><p>Weeks before the release of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), Swift warned her fans about behavior when the record is released. “I was hoping to ask you, that as we lead up to this album coming out, I would love for that kindness and that gentleness to extend onto our internet activities,” Swift said, per&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>fan-recorded videos</a>&nbsp;from the show. “So what I’m trying to say is, I’m putting this album out because I want to own my music and I believe that any artist who has the desire to own their music should be able to. That’s why I’m putting out this album.”</p><p>She continued, “I’m 33 years old, I don’t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote and the memories we made together. So what I’m trying to tell you is that I am not putting this album out so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago when I was 19.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=katy-perry-2012-2015>Katy Perry (2012 – 2015)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-mayer-katy-perry.jpg><p>John Mayer was in an on-and-off relationship with Katy Perry from 2012 to 2015.
