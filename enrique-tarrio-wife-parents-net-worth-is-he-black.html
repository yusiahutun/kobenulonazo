Learn about his wife, parents, net worth, and his ethnicity via this article below. Is he black?</p><p>Get to know more about him as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Enrique Tarrio Ethnicity: Is He Black?</strong></h3><p>According to the New York Times, Enrique Tarrio is of Afro-Cuban ethnicity, so he is mixed rather than Black as in African-American.</p><h3><strong>Enrique Tarrio Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Enrique Tarrio turned 39 years old. His birth year is 1984.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Enrique Tarrio Parents?</strong></h3><p>Enrique Tarrio was born to his parents Enrique Tarrio and his mother <a href=#>Zuny Duarte</a>, a native of Cuba. The couple however are no longer married as their marriage ended in divorce in 1992. At the time, Tarrio was only 8 years old.</p><p>Enrique is working as an automobile mechanic. Zunny has a job in import and export logistics. It is alleged that she has stated that she has never been politically active. However, Tarrio inherited his father’s love of politics.</p><p>According to Zunny, her kid was a typical boy who rarely got into trouble. She mentioned how chatty he was in class.</p><p>“He always liked to share his things,” Zunny says. Tarrio’s family calls him Henry despite his birth certificate carrying the word “Enrique.”</p><p>“This mother stands before you today begging you for leniency for Henry,” Zunny said. She further continued, “We need him home as soon as we can. The Henry that came into the system is not the Henry that’s here today.”</p><h3><strong>Enrique Tarrio Wife</strong></h3><p>Enrique Tarrio is engaged to his soon-to-be wife Erika Flores. According to the Miami New Times, one source referred to Erika as his former girlfriend.</p><p>Erika, a self-described libertarian, served as the youngest delegate for the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the state of Washington. She once noted that many of the early adopters of the Bitcoin movement adhered to an “anarchist” mindset, attributing her love of cryptocurrencies to her libertarian political roots.</p><p>Also, Erika earned a bachelor’s degree in aeronautics science and a private pilot’s certificate from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach in 2014. She reported asking a prominent banker about Bitcoin over a video conference call while employed later at a bank in the airplane leasing sector.</p><p>After working for a while in the trading and leasing of aircraft, Flores changed her focus and started “Miami International Bitcoin” in 2015. She described it as a “meet-up group” that later evolved into a Facebook group where individuals could debate Bitcoin.</p><p>Erika has been described as a “pillar” and “the godmother” of Miami’s cryptocurrency community. In 2019, she and self-described “Bitcoin Pioneer” Nick Spanos founded the Miami Blockchain Center, which they described as an “incubator, event space, and co-working space” to instruct developers, entrepreneurs, and investors on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, a few blocks from Bayfront Park in downtown Miami.</p><p>“We want Miami to be the best-educated city in the world when it comes to this technology,” Flores said at the center’s inception. During its grand opening, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez performed a ribbon-cutting ceremony with an oversized pair of scissors as Flores stood beside him grinning.</p><p>The report claims that Flores gave “1776 Returns,” a plan to storm government buildings near the Capitol, including the House and Senate office buildings and the U.S. Supreme Court, to then-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio one week prior to the January 6, 2021 uprising.</p><p>The document is a key element of the seditious conspiracy allegation that Tarrio and other Proud Boys members are currently facing in a courtroom in Washington, D.C. In correspondence revealed through texts admitted as evidence in the trial, an “Eryk-A” sends the paper to Tarrio at approximately 12:50 p.m. on December 30, 2020.</p><p>“If you don’t like my plan, let me know. I will pitch elsewhere,” one message to Tarrio reads. “But I want you to be the executor and benefitor of my brilliance.” Federal prosecutors in the Tarrio trial have identified the sender of the communications as “Erika Flores,” saying that she invoked the Fifth Amendment and declined to provide information regarding the 1776 Returns document after being served with a subpoena last year. (She is not currently facing any charges.)</p><p>Erika said the couple wants to start a family together and asked the judge to consider the “direct effect” a long sentence could have on those ambitions. “Henry is a flawed man, as are we all, but he is not blind to it.”</p><p>According to the Miami New Times, Enrique was divorced once before.</p><h3><strong>Enrique Tarrio Height</strong></h3><p>Enrique Tarrio’s height is above 5 feet 8 inches.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Enrique Tarrio Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Enrique Tarrio’s net worth is above $400 thousand. According to a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding that Reuters was able to obtain, Enrique, the leader of the extremist group Proud Boys, has a history of working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012.</p><p>A federal prosecutor, an FBI agent, and Tarrio’s own attorney all testified at the Miami hearing about his undercover work and how it assisted law enforcement in the prosecution of more than a dozen individuals in various drug, gambling, and human smuggling offenses. Tarrio denied working undercover or aiding in cases against others in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.</p><p>“I don’t know any of this,” Enrique said when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”</p><p>Enriqye’s denial is refuted by law enforcement officers and the court record. Tarrio’s former federal prosecutor, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed in a statement to Reuters that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from operating marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”</p><p>Enrique was detained by Washington police in early January after arriving in the city two days before the Capitol Hill disturbance. He was accused of burning a Black Lives Matter flag and having two high-capacity rifle magazines during a Donald Trump supporter demonstration in December. Prior to a June court date, the D.C. Superior Court ordered him to leave the city.</p><p>She did not participate in the Capitol uprising, but at least five Proud Boys members have been accused of involvement in the unrest. The earlier detention of Tarrio, according to the FBI, was an attempt to stop the events of January 6.</p><p>Enrique claims he started “hanging out with the wrong people” when he was 15 years old. He was 20 years old when he was found guilty of stealing a $55,000 motorcycle and received a three-year probationary term, community service requirements, and a restitution order.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Enrique Tarrio From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Enrique Tarrio hailed from Miami, Florida.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Enrique Tarrio Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Enrique Tarrio’s birthday is in February.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Enrique Tarrio On Instagram And Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Enrique Tarrio is not on Instagram and Facebook.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmnqainr62sYytmKuqmaR6uLXFnmSpmaKau7W%2FjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyiqmaglWKvra3CpGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fenrique-tarrio-wife-parents-net-worth-is-he-black.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fenrique-tarrio-wife-parents-net-worth-is-he-black.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fenrique-tarrio-wife-parents-net-worth-is-he-black.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fenrique-tarrio-wife-parents-net-worth-is-he-black.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fenrique-tarrio-wife-parents-net-worth-is-he-black.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fenrique-tarrio-wife-parents-net-worth-is-he-black.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./breaking-de-bruyne-injury-city-32351163.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./breaking-de-bruyne-injury-city-32351163.html>Kevin De Bruyne injury before Man City vs Arsenal forces Belgium to leave star at home</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a-floral-affair.html>A Floral Affair</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./a-floral-affair.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
