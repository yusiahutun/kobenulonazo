<time>04 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Former World No.1 Venus Williams has been a professional athlete since she was 14. Since her debut as an athlete, she has won seven Grand Slam, five Wimbledon, and two US Open singles titles, making her one of the most decorated female athletes in the world. Her success over time has fans wondering, who is Venus Williams’ husband?&nbsp;</p><p>While the tennis superstar has been a role model for many young ladies and has been active in the social sphere, the big question about who her spouse is enthralls all. Since news about her sister, Serena expecting baby number two became public, fans have been itching to know about the identity of&nbsp;Venus Williams’ spouse.</p><p>Does he exist?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-13_07-31-45-fotor-2023071373247.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Venus_Williams_Husband></span>Who Is Venus Williams’ Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Contrary to what many believe, the tennis legend has not tied the knot with anyone. Consequently, Venus Williams’ husband does not exist. While her sister has been married since 2017, Venus seems to have a different opinion on marriage. In an interview, she revealed that she gets a lot of questions about her marital status and if she will tie the knot. However, she firmly shut the questions down with a firm “NO.”</p><p>While recording a Live in 2021, she candidly responded to a fan’s question about her love life. She said, “Lots of people ask me to go on a date. I’m just not. I would say I’m undateable, that’s okay, I’m happy.” Although Venus Williams’ husband does not exist, the seven times Grand Slam winner has dated a couple of men.</p><p>Here are some of the men Venus Williams dated.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nicholas_Hammond></span>Nicholas Hammond<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nicholas Hammond is a successful financier and heir to the Annenberg family fortune. The millionaire was born into an affluent family and studied at Trinity School. Following his graduation from high school, he attended New York University. After he graduated from the University, he went on to work as a financier for high-profile clients.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-13_07-31-32-fotor-2023071373439-712x1024.jpg><p>Since Hammond’s upbringing was private, most details about his life before his relationship with Venus are unknown. Venus and now ex-boyfriend Hammond started dating in 2017. Despite the former couple’s 12-year gap, they enjoyed a happy romance. The now-separated couple was spotted packing on the PDA while out and about.&nbsp;</p><p>Hammond often attended his ex-girlfriend’s games, and fans thought the pair would tie the knot. The two attended Serena and Alex Ohanian’s wedding in November 2017 and had fans in a frenzy. However, Venus and Hammond called it quits after nearly two years together in June 2019.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Elio_Pis></span>Elio Pis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Before Nicholas Hammond, there was Elio Pis. Venus started seeing Cuban model Elio Pis when he was 24. Despite the 8-year gap between the pair, they did not shy away from PDAs. The now-separated couple worked together on her clothing line called EleVen and made their first public appearance in 2012 at the New York Grand Slam.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the couple also attended a game in Miami in March 2013, and Venus could barely <a href=#>keep her mind on the game</a>. However, their romance ended after five years of being together in 2017.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hank_Kuehne></span>Hank Kuehne<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Two years before her relationship with the Cuban model became public, Venus was in a relationship with Hank. Like Venus, Hank is an athlete, a pro golfer. Although there are no details regarding how they met, online reports suggest they started dating in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their celebrity status, the now-separated couple kept their brief relationship private. Their romance fizzled out in 2010. While Venus dated other people after they separated, Hank tied the knot with a woman named Andy in 2011.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Venus_Williams_Dating></span>Who Is Venus Williams Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Venus is single for now, and she prefers it that way. In a candid Instagram Live session, the tennis star addressed the questions and rumors surrounding her love life. She shared that many people have expressed interest in dating her, but she prefers being single. Although rumors swirled that she was dating fellow athlete Reilly Opelka, she quickly shut them down.</p><p>While speaking about the societal pressures women face to start a family in an interview, Venus noted that she’s happy living the single life and <a href=#>said</a>, “I have a lot of friends who don’t believe me when I say that I like my life and I don’t want to change it for any reason.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-13_07-31-38-fotor-2023071373324.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Does_Venus_Williams_Have></span>How Many Kids Does Venus Williams’ Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As earlier stated, Venus Williams’ husband does not exist. As such, Venus does not have any children yet. However, she plays a significant role in her niece Olympia’s upbringing. Although she doesn’t have kids yet, Venus is an animal lover and a dog mom.&nbsp;</p><p>While Venus has not revealed plans to tie the knot, fans can’t stop talking about the great strides she has made, like most <a href=#>women in sports</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kw6a61KxksKGcobaiudJmn66rkpa7pXnWoaZmoaNitaZ7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvenus-williams-husband-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvenus-williams-husband-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvenus-williams-husband-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvenus-williams-husband-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvenus-williams-husband-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvenus-williams-husband-who-is-he.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./8-christmas-movies-list-recommendation-romantic-comedy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./8-christmas-movies-list-recommendation-romantic-comedy.html></a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./greys-anatomy-fake-american-accent-bothers-fans-most-html.html>The 'Fake' American Accent That Bothers Fans the Most</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./greys-anatomy-fake-american-accent-bothers-fans-most-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
