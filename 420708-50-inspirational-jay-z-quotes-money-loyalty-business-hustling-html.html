No one understands this better than Jay-Z because he has been ranked as one of the <a href=#>wealthiest rappers </a>in the hip-hop industry. Here are some of his motivating and thought-provoking quotes on money and wealth.</p><ul><li>I don't sit around with my friends and talk about money, ever. On a record, that's different.</li><li>Do you know how many athletes go broke three years after they stop playing? I want to help them hold on to their money. I mean, I know about budgets.</li><li>As kids, we didn't complain about being poor, we talked about how rich we were going to be and made moves to get the lifestyle we aspired to by any means we could. And as soon as we had a little money, we were eager to show it.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a14875c06d9444c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ best Lucky Dube quotes about life, love, success, and politics</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9d981039f402a0da.jpg><ul><li>Money and power don't change you, they just further expose your true self.</li><li>That was the greatest trick in music that people ever pulled off, to convince artists that you can't be an artist and make money. I think people that were making millions said that. It was almost shameful, especially in rock n' roll.</li><li>You make your first album, you make some money, and you feel like you still have to show face, like 'I still go to the projects.' I'm like, why? Your job is to inspire people from your neighbourhood to get out. You grew up there. What makes you think it's so cool?</li><li>The truth is you don't need some external demon to take control of you to turn you into a raging, money-obsessed sociopath, you only need to let loose the demons you already have inside of you.</li><li>One of the reasons inequality gets so deep in this country is that everyone wants to be rich. That's the American ideal. Poor people don't like talking about poverty because even though they might live in the projects surrounded by other poor people and have, like, ten dollars in the bank, they don't like to think of themselves as poor.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/901ff522ca952faf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ coolest swag quotes and captions for Instagram in 2021</span></p></a><h3>Jay-Z quotes about loyalty</h3><p class=align-left>The merits of loyalty are often debated. Anyone who has ever been hurt by someone they considered a true friend can attest to the fact that loyalty is a double-edged sword. Without loyalty, families are broken, and friendships are empty. Here are some of Jay-Z quotes about loyalty.</p><ul><li>Love is absolute loyalty. People fade, looks fade, but loyalty never fades.

Regardless of whether you're trying to make more sales or get more traffic, you got to hustle. Here are some of his famous quotes about hustling.</p><ul><li>I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying.</li><li>Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They don't even have to like your music. If you're big enough, people are drawn to you.</li><li>I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles. Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent. Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench.</li><li>The responsibility is to keep pushing it forward, and not relying on the same old gimmicks. You have to push it forward.</li><li>Everyday hit every wave, like I'm Hawaiian. I don't surf the net, no I've never been on MySpace, too busy letting my voice vibrate, carving out my space in this world.</li><li>Some said 'how'd you fly?'

So there was never a dialogue on 'how did you do it' 'what happened' there was no mentoring program…no going back teaching a person a trade or what you do…so that's why I figured I'd started the school, because education is the answer.</li><li>It just got to a point where it was, like, "Make this decision, because this is something you really love and you love to do. It's time to really focus on and then get serious about it, give it your all." And once I did that, it was no looking back from there.</li><li>I'm a hustler baby; I sell water to a well.</li><li>All I got is dreams. Nobody else believes. Nobody else can see.

We all have the fear of failure…as someone successful the weight of all that you've done is on you.</li><li>I was forced to be an artist and a CEO from the beginning, so I was forced to be like a businessman because when I was trying to get a record deal, it was so hard to get a record deal on my own that it was either give up or create my own company.</li><li>Successful people have a bigger fear of failure than people who've never done anything because if you haven't been successful, then you don't know how it feels to lose it all. You don't have that fear. So why do you think people get stuck in those boxes? It's that fear of going back down.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b0a162aaac5c7567.jpg><ul><li>This is the number one rule for your set, in order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets.</li><li>My brands are an extension of me.

And hopefully, everyone follows.</li><li>Those who are successful overcome their fears and take action. Those who aren't submit to their fears and live with regrets.</li><li>I believe excellence is being able to perform at a high level over and over.</li><li>You learn more in failure than you ever do in success.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Jay-Z has risen from a humble background to become one of the best entertainers in the <a href=#>world</a> of rap music.
