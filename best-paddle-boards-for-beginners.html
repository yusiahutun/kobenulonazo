What follows is his guide to paddle boarding for beginners, written by him...</p><p id=eKiksJNso6U data-wc=29>As someone who has been a big fan of the sport since 2008 I can confirm that paddle boarding is one of the best activities you can get into.</p><p id=eY-qSR-sV9g data-wc=37>You can now put a huge 10-14 foot board in the boot of your car and travel to any water-based destination – and it’s something you can do all year round if you have the right gear.</p><p id=eiWM_uAz4MJ data-wc=58>This is definitely a sport you will want to share with friends and family and it's great for kids – I've recently got my daughters aged 11 and seven into it. The feeling of mindfulness and losing yourself and becoming one with the water as you focus on balance and technique is addictive, whatever your age or ability.&nbsp;</p><p id=eg_8fsFfXmc data-wc=27>Paddleboarding is a low-impact sport that provides a full-body workout and is easy on the joints, making it suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.</p><p id=eJD3y09IK6Ak data-wc=28>You do however need to be aware of your own limitations and confidence in different types of water and taking lessons with a reputable instructor is highly recommended.</p><p id=eoA30n982mrQ data-wc=32>I tried and tested a range of boards, so do keep reading for my top picks… Several are in the sales at the moment, so it's a great time to get involved.</p><p id=eraodLcsqj5e data-wc=38>And a final word from me - paddleboarding is a versatile and enjoyable sport that offers many physical and mental health benefits, making it a good choice for those looking to get into a new sport in 2023.</p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/508f8d70e918-paddleboarding-pic-z.jpg></strong><p id=esNSDujJKLVj data-wc=12><strong>The physical and mental benefits of taking up paddle boarding are immense</strong></p><h2>What to look for when you're buying a paddle board?</h2><p id=exyQDDqlc-5r data-wc=74>If you're just starting out, you'll want a board that gives good stability in order to learn the basics. You want something with good width between 32 and 34 inches as well as 10 foot 6 to 12 foot 6 in length. It’s all in relation to your own body size and weight and heavier riders will also benefit from a nice thick board offering lots of volume ( between 5 and 6 inches).</p><p id=eee9Cs02J0HX data-wc=59>Smaller riders will probably want a slightly smaller board and could drop to a thinner thickness ( between 4.75 and 5 inches) You will be surprised at how quickly you can progress if you put time and practice in on the water - as well as improving fitness you will gain better balance and a more confident stroke technique.</p><p id=exJzBWCTcojv data-wc=61>As you gain confidence in your ability you may want to progress with doing longer distances and want to go faster. The less width and longer the board, the faster you will go. Start with a good all-round board to gain your confidence in relation to your body size and consider upgrading if you find your passion grow for the sport.</p><p id=e4LyZRvZL32r data-wc=32>Quality boards tend to hold their price when selling second hand if you look after them and you will have a better idea of what kind of paddler you want to become.</p><p id=e0SLmSesRvK8 data-wc=34>It's always worth trying out as many boards as possible before choosing the right one that feels right for your ability. You can do this by taking some initial lessons or by hiring boards.</p><p id=e4W1KBvZdB-4 data-wc=58>This will also give you an idea of what you want to get out paddle boarding- touring and exploring on flat water, surfing in small waves, racing, having fun with the family at the beach or lakes…. If you become addicted to the sport you will find that you may want a range of boards for different situations.</p><p id=e3-Zf_WZsgnd data-wc=39>Paddle board expert Gary Willingham from fantastic SUP-focused UK retailer <span><a aria-label="Sup Inflatables" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Sup Inflatables</a></span> has this top tip: "Find a local or online SUP specific retailer. They are gods of SUP and will help you choose something great in your budget."</p><p id=eZA4uFU-bzjb data-wc=44>As for what to avoid when buying a paddle board online, he says: &nbsp;"Don't buy a brand that has a kayak seat on, talks about Military Grade drop stitch, offers free stuff, or has a warranty that's so long you fall asleep reading it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28b6e56a0411-paddle-boarding-on-lake.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>How we chose the best iSUPs</h2><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Testing:&nbsp;</strong>Our expert reviewer took the boards out on the river and sea and assessed each one individually looking for stability and quality and gave his honest feedback on each board.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Reviews:</strong> In the case where were unable to test the boards personally, we focused on reviews by verified shoppers and only included boards that had a large volume of positive reviews, consistently getting the thumbs up for quality, value for money and stability.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Trusted brands:</strong> We only included brands with a good track record and reputation that stands behind their products.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Price:</strong> Paddle boards can range in price from a few hundred pounds to thousands. We included boards to suit all budgets, without sacrificing on quality. Though there are some very good value affordable boards on the market, there are also some terrible, poorly-made cheap boards, but you certainly won’t find any of those in this feature.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Variety:</strong> Some riders might want to paddle on flat water, others might want to catch waves. Some may even want to practice yoga. We tried to cater for all kinds of riders in this roundup.</li></ul><h2>Best all-rounder: <strong data-gid=eJLJzkEZSbFW>Portofino Paddle Board Package</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9485dc3cb78b-red-trail-portofino-paddle-board-z.jpg><ul><li>Length: 10</li><li>Width: 33"</li><li>Thickness: 4.75"</li><li>Weight: 7.8kg</li></ul><p id=eBCObZJ3rEY- data-wc=50>We tested out the brand-new 'red Trail Portofino Inflatable SUP' and loved it, it's a true all-rounder. The expert engineering of the design is so supportive and rigid that you completely forget that you are on an inflatable SUP, even if you are manoeuvring over choppy waves on the sea.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZDo-uSUCLRb data-wc=37>We were also impressed that for the 10ft length of the board, it weighs in at just 7.8kg which makes it incredibly easy to carry down to the water if you're heading out on a solo paddle.</p><p id=e-WVG1xqqxfM data-wc=27>Rest assured that this attractive board also comes with very easy-to-follow assembly instructions and absolutely everything that you need to set up the board, including repair patches.&nbsp;</p><h2>Best entry-level budget stand-up paddle boards for beginners</h2><h3><strong data-gid=eBVIWterOHH9>Goosehill Inflatable Premium SUP Package</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f5a070731b92-paddleboard-deal-z.jpg><ul><li data-gid=eWL-9nOuKE4n>Length: 10</li><li data-gid=erQSTEIGWRd_>Width: 32"</li><li data-gid=etKssb8XkGUm>Thickness: 6"</li><li data-gid=eXODTkzK-e3P>Weight: 13.9kg</li></ul><p id=evRQwYAY1Cuw data-wc=73>A good choice for beginners to SUP that will take you through to the intermediate stage, this board can comfortably hold an adult and two small children.

It's also lightweight and easy to transport and carry and available in blue and aquamarine colourways.</p><h3>Aqua Marina Fusion, Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board (iSUP) Package</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d794d06748c1-aqua-marina-board-z.jpg><ul><li>Length: 10-10</li><li>Width: 32"</li><li>Thickness: 6"</li><li>Weight: 8.6kg</li></ul><p id=eyEdIlzelq80 data-wc=93>This popular budget board has proved reliable as a starter board for entry-level fun. It's lightweight and the grab handle is in just the right place for carrying it into the water. The three-piece paddle fits in the bag easily and once connected together feels solid. The board comes with everything you need to get started, including a robust hand pump with decent grips and a release plus that makes the pump two or one-way action – you can use it to suck the air out, making it very easy to pack away.</p><h3 dir=ltr>MY Pointbreak 10’6 Stand Up Paddleboard</h3><ul data-gid=e_Y5fcQ_cxY><li data-gid=esG-nIgYBID>Length: 10-6</li><li data-gid=eRPWAS5m64n>Width: 30"</li><li data-gid=e9VIgKJaJUB>Thickness: 6"</li><li data-gid=edaAsGUUeZ93>Weight: 8.4kg</li></ul><p id=eiM8y71O8gOe data-wc=136>We had a lot of fun trying out this board on lakes, rivers and the sea. The board comes in a decent bag that is easy to carry. Inside it has everything needed to get onto the water- pump, leash and three-piece paddle. As a low-cost board it offers good value for getting onto the water. It's great for children to get a taste of paddle boarding and was light enough for our nine-year-old and 13-year-old to carry the board to the water and offered enough stability for them to paddle as well as having lots of fun jumping on and off the board and gaining lots of confidence. With a good-sized centre fin that is easy to fit onto the board, it worked well when playing in the sea as well as the flat water.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAFsRnCr9g5Z data-wc=107>The paddle is adjustable which was great for using across the whole family and proved to be more reliable than other low-cost packages. The foot decking was also comfortable and offered enough grip when paddling which made the whole experience highly enjoyable. The 6 inch thickness offers enough float for adults and at 10’6 in length, we managed to even have lots of fun paddling into some very small waves with lots of laughs falling off. If you’re looking for a low-cost board that will get you onto the water and something that packs away into your car easily then this is a great little starter board.</p><h2><strong data-gid=efQI6wuzgd7a>Bluefin cruise SUP package</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19717d0a1bc1-blufin-sup-z.jpg><ul><li>Length: 10-8</li><li>Width: 32"</li><li>Thickness: 6"</li><li>Weight: 8.6kg</li></ul><p id=ehbhe-6Xu0GO data-wc=35>An entry-level paddle board for lighter riders, which again comes with everything you possibly need to get started, including paddle, pump and backpack.

It's great on flat water and on the sea with small waves.</p><p id=eWCh0syrApYC data-wc=33>It comes with a high-quality carry bag and a Titan pump - the best pump on the market, Pumps are an overlooked item and having a good quality one makes such a difference.</p><p id=eF05G-JUdXzb data-wc=117>Due to its size the board is great for kids as well as adults. It's one of the lightest ISUP boards on the market (due to fantastic build quality) making it easy for children as well as smaller adults to pick up and carry to the water. The five-piece paddle which comes with the board - which also fits very cleverly in the bag for storage - is also very good quality and can be adjusted for children to use as well as the whole family. It's so easy to transport and is great to just keep in the car and get in the water after work. I've even travelled with it on my back when cycling.</p><p id=e3YrWBf09MMb data-wc=28>This is one of the more pricey ISUPS but the quality of these boards is second to none, plus the customer service and after sales care are fantastic.</p><h2>Best deluxe paddle board for heavier beginners who struggle with balance: Red Paddle Co <strong data-gid=eowbEHE2QcGy>11 Feet Red Compact Package</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19717d0a1bc1-blufin-sup-z.jpg><ul><li>Length: 11</li><li>Width: 32"</li><li>Thickness: 4.75"</li><li>Weight: 8.4kg</li></ul><p id=eBp51gEJmGam data-wc=83>Heavier or larger riders would be best choosing the 11foot version rather than the smaller 9-6.

It's one of the cheaper boards on the market but note, it doesn’t come with a paddle and pump like most of the other packages.</p><h2>Best paddle board that can be shared by the whole family: <strong data-gid=eEe4d9qyEnZh1>Red 10-6 Ride SUP Inflatable package</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4b9e8fbb39d-gladiator-board-z.jpg><ul><li>Length: 10-6</li><li>Width: 32"</li><li>Thickness: 4.75"</li><li>Weight 9.95kg</li></ul><p id=ebGLwEK76e3hT data-wc=84>If you're looking for a board that could be used by the whole family that can be trusted for high quality and safety then the 10-6 Ride is a great choice.

There is a bit more of a rocker in the front of the board which helps to move through choppy waters. It also copes well with having a small child or dog on the front of the board on flat water. The width makes it very stable for beginners who are totally new to being on the water.</p><p id=eSKsa1mCSxk-y data-wc=86>The quality of the board makes it feel very rigid and strong - allowing you to just get out and have fun on the water. The bag that the board comes with is well thought out with lots of space for the board pump and paddle to fit into. It was lots of fun in the sea testing on very small waves and also was great getting onto rivers for short tours- I managed it well with small child on the front of the board too.</p><h2>Best beginners paddle board for rivers and lakes: <strong data-gid=eyiOHMtUfSKfF>10-6 x 32 Gladiator Pro</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c03a65f89928-dog-life-jacket-z.jpg><ul><li>Length: 10-6"</li><li>Width: 32"</li><li>Thickness: 4.75"</li><li>Weight: 8.9kg</li></ul><p id=etJatGFE1QzWY data-wc=93>A great board for beginners that is slightly thinner than other models we tested but when pumped up to high pressure feels very stable and rigid. It manages well with a small child on the front of the board on flat water. This is an amazing quality board for its price range – and although the bag and pump are not on par with the top end of the market versions they're still very reliable and the board itself was made to a high standard and felt safe and rigid in the water.</p><p id=eEuBBgURwoecr data-wc=42>This board proved great for touring on rivers and lakes – it feels lower in the water which makes it feel more stable. Heavier beginner riders may struggle a bit more, however, and would probably benefit from a longer or thicker board.</p><h2>Essential paddleboard kit</h2><h3><strong data-gid=es1BxKqVB3FNO>Dryrobe</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03a83efbf372-nixie-wetsuit.jpg><p id=eo46u_vB8j0BB data-wc=44>Being on the water, whether sea, lake or river, will inevitably involve you spending a lot of time being out in the elements- getting the most enjoyment, mindfulness and fun out of these situations is a lot easier if you have the right clothing.</p><p id=eh8W9vqI9greZ data-wc=96>We tested one of the long sleeve dryrobes during our paddle sessions which proved to be such a great addition to the whole experience of keeping cosy and warm before and after. On the sea it offered the ability to get changed into and out of wetsuits before and after the sessions and on river and lake it proved to be an item you just wanted to put on and keep cosy and comfortable in while waiting to get on the water or after each session when cooling down and chatting as the sun went down.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6_pNtn4qfJVO data-wc=121>The change in temperatures when out by water does change quite dramatically if you are out all day and I can't stress how useful this robe is for someone who spends a lot of time outdoors- it's something I will use not just for SUP experiences but is so useful for all manner of outdoor activities. It's a really well-designed item with such attention to detail and quality. The inner lining,&nbsp;oversized pockets, quality zips and waterproof outer lining just make&nbsp;you want to spend time outdoors and in no rush to return home no matter what the weather.&nbsp;Even on hot days when you are doing an early start or for when the sun goes down it's the perfect addition.</p><h3><strong data-gid=eVnTewL-Fweue>Dog buoyancy aid</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/22544db6623f-swim-jacket-z.jpg><p id=eItAXAt6JmAFS data-wc=139>It is such an amazing experience to share your SUP adventures with your kids and dogs once you gain your confidence in your own ability on the water. There are lots of PFD Life Jackets on the market for children and it is great to see that there are now companies producing buoyancy aids for dogs. We tried out one of Red’s buoyancy aids for dogs over the past month on rivers and in the sea. This has been a great safety aid for our small Bichon Frise who loves to be out with us on the water but not a great swimmer. It has given us peace of mind when he is on the front of the board. When he jumps in, the grab handle on the top makes it easy to pull him back onto the board.</p><p id=eQ73wfRmxB3SQ data-wc=58>Really impressed with the quality and the overall design which has been well thought out. Ergonomically designed to support the dog in the water and give them a positive swimming position. Packed full of features and made using durable, tear-resistant Cordura® fabric, the Red Original Dog Buoyancy Aid is available in 5 different sizes to cover all breeds.</p><h3><strong data-gid=e9UnMzR1z7C>Nixie Women's Shorty Wetsuit</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1aab38a1c14e-buoyoncy-aid-z.jpg><p id=e08hcY6EA8 data-wc=121>We tested the Nixie Women's Shorty Wetsuit - which is a great piece of kit of warm water sessions. It fits true to size (It's available in sizes 8-10) was easy to get on and off and feels like a second skin - very comfortable and allows ease of movement. It has back zip entry with a vertical 10 zip and a long pull tab for improved access. It's made from extremely durable fabric and has UPF 50+, with sun protection factor treatment of 50+. The wetsuit has a thickness of up to 3.5mm which is designed for 15-20°C it's panelled with a 3.5mm thick torso to improve core temperature and 3mm on arms and legs to enhance freedom of movement.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong data-gid=epesL4c2kBV0t>Swimbest swim jacket</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d36f361ae27f-red-long-jacket-z.jpg><p id=eEzezCDnoiW66 data-wc=78>If you're going on the water with little ones, it's essential to invest in a buoyancy aid or swim jacket for them, especially when they're just learning how to swim. This is Amazon's best-seller, which is suitable for 16 months to seven years and comes in a rainbow of different colours. It's fitted with floats which you can remove to adjust the buoyancy, and the jacket design means they have a full range of motion in the water</p><p id=eKqNimq4zu7i data-wc=5><strong data-gid=eblsLZ79w_0Zr>Decathalon inflatable buoyancy aid belt</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4e465a03ab50-carry-strap-2023-z.jpg><p id=eJruCnSgTy8ae data-wc=29>Or for adults, use this inflatable buoyancy aid belt. Lightweight and compact, it's for paddleboarders of all levels who are looking for more freedom and safety on the water.</p><h3><strong data-gid=eDVH_5_BwEOTi>Women's long sleeve pro change robe</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/89f5a24a91d1-red-kid-robe-z.jpg><p id=e079CfGey7GsT data-wc=80>We tested the Pro Change long sleeve jacket from Red which came in an alpine teal colour. (There's also a <span><a aria-label="pro chage jacket" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">short sleeved version</a></span> available for £119.95 and you can see the <span><a aria-label="Red Paddle changing jackets" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">men's versions here</a></span>.) The soft and light feel to these jackets is amazing and I have used this not just for changing in and out of my wetsuit but it is so comfortable I find myself wearing it for chilling out on the beach in all kinds of weather.</p><p id=e0veziHxytjzw data-wc=108>The quality and design features, as is always the case with Red, make these jackets such amazing quality and are well worth the price. The triple-layer construction with super soft fur lining keeps you warm when catching up with friends after a session, even if the rain is lashing down. Handy chest pockets are great to keep your valuables close to hand whilst staying dry and premium 2-way YKK zips with finger pulls make doing the changing robe up simple no matter how cold your hands are. These jackets are great for water sports but I also find that they can be used in so many other activities.</p><h3><strong data-gid=eNfAXRNZtgjaq>Paddle Board carry strap</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c025335ed24-water-shoes-z.jpg><p id=eQRQl-UAz1k5O data-wc=45>If you're in the market for a carry strap, this one is a good option because its adjustable length is longer than others - meaning that whatever size your board is, there's no problem. The velcro straps mean you can slot in your paddle too.</p><h3><strong data-gid=eM_o4GAeCwo5d>Red Paddle co: Kids quick dry change robe</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8bead98a5414-titan-pump-z.jpg><p id=eRqNXHYEQ6rTZ data-wc=70>Our two children love to wear these on the beach and have been great bits of kit for changing in and out of wetsuits and bathers. The suede microfibre feels amazing and our kids wanted to wear these all the time. Quick-drying and packs up super small in its own bag - this has become an essential beach accessory which we will always pack for beach adventures from now on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3570b953c2d2-paddle-boarding-book-z.jpg><p id=eolA6tTw31rpm data-wc=50>If you need to walk over rocks or pebbles to get your SUP out on the water - or just don't want to go barefoot - these water shoes are a great solution.

This can be quite exhausting and many struggle to inflate their boards to the correct pressure. Different brands offer different pumps within their packages and this really does make a difference in being able to get your board pumped up with the highest pressure.</p><p id=efClH0YpCoLIN data-wc=84>The best pump on the market at the moment is undoubtedly the Titan 2 SUP Pump from Red. We have tested this pump out and it is incredible compared to other pumps on the market. When out with a group of friends it regularly gets shared and passed around. The design of the pump is so well thought out with fold-away foot grips and a detachable handle and hose so the double chamber can easily fit into bags or the back of the car.</p><p id=eGMEKmg1wwpn4 data-wc=80>The dual cylinder offers an easier and more effective pumping action and a lot of friends of smaller size found it easier to pump up their boards to a much higher pressure than their regular pumps. The Titan2 SUP Pump is definitely a great investment to add to your enhanced experience of getting onto the water with your board. It also comes with a range of additional nozzles which we have used for blowing up camping beds and rubber dinghies.</p><p id=eHRThABdAs3L data-wc=8><strong data-gid=eU7MYpzMkODXV>Stand up Paddle Boarding in Great Britain book</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=epsL-kOQ2DfHo data-wc=73>Okay, so it's not strictly a piece of kit, but this is an excellent book for anyone who's on the lookout for the best spots in the UK for SUP.
