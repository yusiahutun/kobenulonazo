<time>20 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p id=exMHjiR7qi data-wc=60>When we think of <a class=hm-link href=#>the royal family</a>, tattoos aren't necessarily what springs to mind. They tend to have a strict protocol when it comes to appearance, from makeup and jewellery to nail polish colour and even the shade of their tights. So, it comes as a huge surprise when royals show off an edgy inking, whether that's permanent or temporary.</p><p id=eIg8caqZJCw data-wc=74>Over the years, plenty of royals have shown off some nifty tattoos; including<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>who showed off her subtle ink while stepping out to a royal event in 2022. Not only that, but <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Amelia Windsor</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>has several on her ribcage, left hand, and wrists, and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Sofia</a> famously displayed the sun tattoo between her shoulder blades on her wedding day. <strong>Read on to find out</strong><strong>&nbsp;which royals have been tempted by tattoos…</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Meghan Markle previously enjoyed having a henna tattoo</figure><h2 data-gid=e7kaZ3ymkwQw dir=ltr><strong data-gid=ej530hyhAMg8>Princess Eugenie</strong></h2><p id=e5kNOQ3LCS data-wc=39>Yes, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie</a> has a tattoo! The royal has a very small ink behind her ear and fans have spotted the subtle tattoo a number of times while Princess Eugenie has stepped out for various engagements over the years.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss...</h4><p id=eXdvyHQiXmI data-wc=78>It's not known when the royal had her ink done, but in the below image, showing the royal attending the Thanksgiving Service at St Paul's Cathedral to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee in 2022, Eugenie's hair was pinned away from her face meaning her delicate circle tatt behind her left ear was visible. The meaning behind the circle tattoo is not known, but some royals fans believe she had it done to honour her late grandmother, the Queen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e1b61d71048f-eugenie-thanksgiving.jpg><h2>Queen Camilla</h2><p id=e2HfkW7yCt3 data-wc=67>Although <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Camilla</a> does not have permanent ink, the Queen did partake in some henna activities while on an official engagement in 2011 with her husband, King Charles, then Prince Charles, while in Zanzibar. The Queen Consort visited a henna tattooist and had her own ink creation painted on her hand. The royal couple were on a four-day trip to Tanzania to highlight environmental issues in Africa.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14f8292d28e6-queen-camilla-with-henna.jpg><h2>Princess Kate</h2><p id=eiEEmjgCNCJ data-wc=72>Much like her mother-in-law, the Queen, the <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess of Wales</a> doesn't have a permanent tattoo, but she has enjoyed having a temporary henna in the past. In February 2018, while seven months pregnant with Louis, the Princess received a small henna tattoo while marking the opening of a new artist’s residence in Sunderland. Wonder how it faded so fast? Henna is a natural dye that only lasts around one to four weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2012026df43-kate-middleton.jpg><h2>Meghan Markle</h2><p id=eg-8KJaSsWq data-wc=65>During the royal couple's trip to Morocco in 2019, <a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle</a> was given a henna tattoo by teenager Samira who has lived in Asni for six years - the henna flower was created on Meghan’s right hand to celebrate her pregnancy as per Moroccan tradition. Samira explained: "It is a traditional practice for pregnant women in Morocco. It is to bring luck for the baby."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/50c4045d5302-meghan-henna-2.jpg><p id=eRfMfweXGgHB data-wc=50>When the artwork was completed, Meghan said: "That’s really lovely," and proudly showed it to husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a>, who was sitting next to her. Meghan added: "It will dry for a little bit and then we can walk through." Here's a close-up photo of Meghan with her beautiful henna tattoo...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7fce7b7e32d8-meghan-markle-henna.jpg><h2>Doria Ragland</h2><p id=eBq9fp11OwH data-wc=90>Like mother, like daughter! The Duchess of Sussex's mother, Doria Ragland, <a class=hm-link href=#>showed off her beautifully artistic arm ink</a> while stepping out in Beverly Hills recently. Wearing a chic red strappy jumpsuit, the yoga instructor's tattoo was on full display. The ink is a floral design, with some royal fans theorising that Doria's tattoo could be a tribute to Meghan as she refers to her daughter as 'flower'. One of the flowers is a lily, could this also be a tribute to her granddaughter Lilibet?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10818ec94809-doriaragland.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Lady Amelia Windsor</strong></h2><p id=eQZMc7i8H3 data-wc=38>Something of an it-girl, <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Amelia Windsor</a> is the granddaughter of Prince Edward. The Duke of Kent and the late Queen Elizabeth II were first cousins through their fathers, King George VI and Prince George, Duke of Kent.</p><p id=eqBbpE_VNZ1 data-wc=46>Amelia isn't shy about expressing her personal style. Inked in more places than one, the stylish royal showed off her rib cage tattoo while attending the Serpentine Summer Party. She also has tattoos on each of her wrists and a tiger on her left-hand shoulder blade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8308516334f2-amelia-windsor-tattoo.jpg><h2>Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark</h2><p id=eBBbuKum1Qr data-wc=84>The heir to the Danish throne, Crown Prince Frederik will become King with two tatts but it's something that's not unusual in his family. His grandfather, King Frederik IX, who ruled Denmark from 1947 to his death in 1972 had tattoos of dragons and birds on his torso. Why? Because, just like Prince Frederik, who has a shark on his calf and a tattoo on his arm that means 'pingu', the chosen symbols are used to represent their time served in the Danish Navy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5b8fe4783f8c-crown-prince-frederik.jpg><h2>Princess Sofia, Duchess of Värmland</h2><p id=eBKeGB4dM-2 data-wc=51>Before marrying Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, who is fourth in line to the Swedish throne, Princess Sofia worked as a glamour model and reality television star. After getting together with her future husband she wasn't just going to erase her tattoos because she was becoming royal. Quite right, too.</p><p id=e_Yp3QMOv4n data-wc=52>On her wedding day, a sun between her shoulder blades was visible and on a holiday a few years, she revealed a large tattoo of a flying butterfly on her ribcage. She also has a minute inking on her ankle and is said to have previously had a motif on her arm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/20cad83b24f1-sofia-wedding-tattoo.jpg><h2>Princess Stéphanie of Monaco</h2><p id=eZRCZuDS2fS data-wc=72>The youngest daughter of American actress Grace Kelly and Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, Princess Stéphanie was lovingly called 'wild child' by her mother when she was growing up. After her mother was killed in a car accident in 1982, while Stéphanie was riding with her, she reportedly grew more rebellious and opted for several tattoos including a floral bracelet, two jumping dolphins on her foot and a motif on her back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef785b47c331-stephanie-of-monaco.jpg><h2>Pauline Ducruet</h2><p id=efnDsw8TBvE data-wc=59>Pauline Ducruet is the daughter of Princess Stéphanie of Monaco and is 14th in line to the Monegasque throne. Like mother, like daughter, she's also partial to visiting the tattoo parlour and has a floral motif on her wrist too. A daisy to be precise. She also has a small circle inked on the inside of her left ear.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c3bab2dd160-pauline-ducruet.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGtycGZshXC%2BzrKYpatdrLa1tIytmK2sn6TAbrzRoqWcnaOoeqyt056qZqCZmbGmuoyaqa1lpKR6sb7Ip5qeq6NisrazxKegnmWimq%2BmuMuipq6rXZ67rHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froyals-with-tattoos-princess-kates-hidden-art-to-princess-eugenie-rebellious-ink.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2froyals-with-tattoos-princess-kates-hidden-art-to-princess-eugenie-rebellious-ink.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2froyals-with-tattoos-princess-kates-hidden-art-to-princess-eugenie-rebellious-ink.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2froyals-with-tattoos-princess-kates-hidden-art-to-princess-eugenie-rebellious-ink.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froyals-with-tattoos-princess-kates-hidden-art-to-princess-eugenie-rebellious-ink.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2froyals-with-tattoos-princess-kates-hidden-art-to-princess-eugenie-rebellious-ink.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./403250-shahs-of-sunset-cast-net-worth-who-richest-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./403250-shahs-of-sunset-cast-net-worth-who-richest-html.html>Shahs Of Sunset cast net worth 2022: Who is the richest?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-lip-fillers-can-change-smile-hide-teeth.html>How lip fillers can affect your smile</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-lip-fillers-can-change-smile-hide-teeth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
