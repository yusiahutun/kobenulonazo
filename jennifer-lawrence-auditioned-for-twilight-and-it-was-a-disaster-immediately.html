Based on the best-selling Stephenie Meyer novels, the five-<a href=#>movie</a> series began with Twilight in 2008 and announced <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> and Kristen Stewart as huge stars thanks to lead roles as Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, respectively. Lots of hopeful actresses tried out for the sought-after Bella role, and it turns out the one and only <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> was among the auditionees…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-2077303212-1024x683.jpg><p>The 33-year-old American actress would be established as a franchise star four years after the release of Twilight thanks to her leading role in The Hunger Games, reprising the role of Katniss Everdeen in three sequels.</p><p>During an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">episode</a> of the movie podcast The Rewatchables, Jennifer was invited as a guest to discuss a favorite film of hers, the 1994 comedy classic Dumb And Dumber. Taking a detour in the conversation, she admitted to the host that she tried out for the vampire romance blockbuster.</p><p>“I auditioned for Twilight,” she started. “They turned me down immediately. I didn’t even get a callback. But my life would’ve been totally different. I got Hunger Games I think, like, a year later. It was probably after Winter’s Bone,” an acclaimed 2010 thriller.</p><p>“I was still in a franchise, so I was still trying to counteract the franchise-ness,” she remarked on her Hunger Games years, remembering that she would do other films in between installments so she wouldn’t be pigeonholed.</p><p>“I’d still be doing that if I was in Twilight. But I almost didn’t do Hunger Games because ‘Twilight’ had come out and that fandom had happened.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jlaw-on-why-she-didn-t-get-the-twilight-role>JLaw on why she didn’t get the Twilight role</h2><p>As you know, the Bella role was given to Kristen and the rest is history. You may be thinking that the part would have been well suited to JLaw, and you wouldn’t be the only person to think so.</p><p>When previously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interviewed</a> on The Howard Stern Show, the titular host asked: “Why didn’t you get that? I would think you would be good for that.”</p><p>It’s a fair question, but the No Hard Feelings actress admits that there was a major gap in her knowledge when it came to the source material and the nature of the project.</p><p>“I didn’t really know what it was,” she revealed. “When you audition when you’re like, you know, like a run of the mill actor, you know we’re all auditioning for all sorts of things, you just get like five pages, and then they’re like ‘Act, monkey’. When it came out I was like ‘Hot damn, whoa, yeah’,” realizing just how much of a big deal it was.</p><p>When asked if she was jealous she wasn’t in the movie, she replied that she wasn’t and recalled having that same conversation with the now two-time <a href=#>Oscar</a>-winner <a href=#>Emma Stone</a>.</p><p>However, she did admit she was envious when she didn’t get the lead role in Tim Burton’s reimagining of Alice In Wonderland starring Mia Wasikowska. “That one devastated me,” she revealed.</p><p>Twilight may have been quite different with somebody else in the role, but the KStew stans wouldn’t hear of it.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z%2BcLbEp6WinpWneq2t1qucp5uVYq62sMitoKimlZl6p7vRZquwoZyetKnAjJqlnWWZqXq4rdJmmGacmaiutMDEq2SipZ2asaqt056jsmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-lawrence-auditioned-for-twilight-and-it-was-a-disaster-immediately.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjennifer-lawrence-auditioned-for-twilight-and-it-was-a-disaster-immediately.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-lawrence-auditioned-for-twilight-and-it-was-a-disaster-immediately.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjennifer-lawrence-auditioned-for-twilight-and-it-was-a-disaster-immediately.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-lawrence-auditioned-for-twilight-and-it-was-a-disaster-immediately.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-lawrence-auditioned-for-twilight-and-it-was-a-disaster-immediately.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kate-winslet-has-3-kids-from-3-husbands-meet-mia-joe-and-bear.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kate-winslet-has-3-kids-from-3-husbands-meet-mia-joe-and-bear.html>Kate Winslet Kids From 3 Husbands: Meet Mia, Joe and Bear</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./isabella-rossellini-interview.html>Isabella Rossellini on Redefining Beauty, Farm Life, and Her Pandemic Fling</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./isabella-rossellini-interview.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
