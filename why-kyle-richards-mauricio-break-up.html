Since the news of their separation, Bravo fans have been wondering: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Why did Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky break up</a> and what is the real reason for their split?&nbsp;Kyle, who has been a cast member on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills since Season 1, and Mauricio married on January 20, 1996.</p><p>Mauricio was Kyle’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>second husband after her marriage</a> to her first husband, Guraish Aldjufrie, in 1988. Kyle and Guraish, who share a daughter Farrah Brittany, separated in 1990 and divorced in 1992.&nbsp;Kyle and Mauricio welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Alexia, in 1996. Their second child, a daughter named Sophia, was born in 2000. Their third and final child, a daughter named Portia, was born in 2008. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2021, Kyle and Mauricio talked about the pressure <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> put on their marriage. “If you can survive a marriage on reality TV, you can survive at all,” Mauricio said. “There’s no question.”</p><p>Kyle added, “It’s certainly not what we expected. I mean, I was an actor all my life and my family had been in the public eye, but we never expected this turn. I never expected to do reality television and what that would do to our lives. But we definitely face some challenges, because I think that when you have something great — and people see how happy you are — the more they kind of come after it. So, you know, people always say to me, ‘You should write a book on how to have the best relationship.’ As soon as I do that, people want to come after me. So now it’s like, you get more protective, but it’s definitely made us stronger. We’ve learned just to be even more protective of our relationship, and appreciate it.”</p><p>After 27 years of marriage, news broke of Kyle and Mauricio’s separation in July 2023. So <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>why did Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky break up</a>?

Frankly we are all sick of him using the Hilton name every chance he gets to plug his lame show. It is enough already..”</p><p>In his show Buying Beverly Hills, Mauricio talked about trying to be a partner at Hilton and Hyland where he “got kind of f—.”</p><p>He recounted, “And when I say: “f***ed,” you know, like, today I’m happy, but there was 100 agents at Hilton & Hyland. They did a billion dollars for the first time a year, I was 19.6% of their production, and I went to Rick and said: “I’d really like equity, right? And to be a partner.”</p><p>“Then I went home,” he continued. “I talked to Kyle, I go: “This is really gonna cause a lot of stress between you and your sister and your family, and I don’t wanna do this move of leaving and starting a company if you’re not comfortable.'”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=23.118068833652><h2>February 20, 2024: Kyle denies Mauricio cheated</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kyle-richards-1.png><p>In the finale of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which aired on February 21, 2024, Kyle teared up as she talked <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>about her separation from Mauricio</a>. She reiterated that cheating had nothing to do with their split.</p><p>“There’s literally nothing to do with anybody else,” she told her co-star, Erika Girardi. “This is really just about Mo and me. It’s not about our family. It’s not about external family. It’s not about another person –&nbsp;on his side or my side. This is just about Mo and me.”</p><p>She hinted that they may have grown apart, explaining: “When we first met, we were really opposites. Complete opposites. And that worked. I always would joke and say – if it wasn’t for me, he would be dead, because I keep him safe. And if it wasn’t for him, I would never take chances in life,” the mother of four continues as she chokes up. “And that worked. And also like — we always grew. Because we’ve been together since our early twenties.”</p><p>Erika said Kyle should be proud because their marriage lasted “a really long time”, to which Kyle’s tears began to well. “I know. And it is very admirable and it’s always been something I’m very proud of.”</p><p>“You should still be proud, Kyle,” said Erika, to which Kyle said: “I’m not proud right now,” explaining that her marriage breakdown has been a “letdown” to everyone. “For me, for him, for the kids, for people who don’t even know us. I mean complete strangers are like, ‘We looked up to you guys and you made us believe in true love,’ ” Kyle continued.</p><p>Erika said: “You have to make yourself happy. You’ve raised these girls. You’ve been a good wife to this man. You’ve been a great sister, a great daughter, but if you’re not happy inside – whatever that means for you — you must take that time and find out what you need, and where you need to go with this life,” she advises her longtime friend. Kyle concluded, wiping tears away: “And if we can’t work it out?”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9289176090468><h2>November 7, 2023: No prenup</h2><p>On November 7, 2023, TMZ reported that Kyle and Mauricio <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>didn’t have a prenup</a> and they have no plans to go down the divorce road. “There’s a fortune on the table if that apparent slip of the tongue becomes reality … although sources with direct knowledge tell us neither Kyle nor Mauricio has lawyered up,” the tabloid said. “Multiple sources tell TMZ … Kyle and Mauricio are not directly talking about ending their marriage, but we’re told the thought is certainly present … so the division of assets is something to consider, assuming they decide to cross that bridge.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9008620689655><h2>November 5, 2023: Kyle cries at BravoCon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1776965301.jpg><p>While at BravoCon 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyle Richards teared up</a> while discussing her separation from Mauricio, Page Six reported. “This is not my idea of my fairy tale, clearly,” she said during Sunday’s panel in Las Vegas.

It’s sad, pathetic and bound to bite you in the ass inevitably.”</span><p>Dorit also denied the rumors in an interview on Watch What Happens Live in September 2022. “I mean, what do you think I feel?” “Honey, listen, when something is so ridiculous, you just kind of discount it,” she said. “It’s something that sticks a chord only because Mau, PK, Kyle and I, we’re friends together and it is such a nothing and to have someone start those vile rumors, it’s gross.”&nbsp;<span> </span>Dorit, who told host Andy Cohen that she didn’t want to “give air to” the rumor, also called the speculation “annoying as F.” PK, who was in the audience for the episode, also joked, “When she’s got steak, why would she want a cheeseburger?”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLW6ecqyo55lop6wqa3RnapmpZGqv6qvyKhkm6qVlrhuwc9o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-kyle-richards-mauricio-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-kyle-richards-mauricio-break-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-kyle-richards-mauricio-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-kyle-richards-mauricio-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-kyle-richards-mauricio-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-kyle-richards-mauricio-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./623dca92268e3e6c408b45e4-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./623dca92268e3e6c408b45e4-html.html>Episodio 87 de Shingeki no Kyojin temporada 4 parte 2: fecha, hora y dnde verlo online</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./matt-gutman-wife.html>Who is Matt Gutman Married to?
