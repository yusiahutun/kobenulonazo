We want something that<strong> pairs well with acne-treatments</strong> and <strong>soothes the skin </strong>after a particularly bad breakout. It can be a long and frustrating journey to find the best acne-prone moisturizer that works for you all alone, so we took the reigns and <strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tested </a>19 of the best rated moisturizers, </strong>which were specifically formulated for acne-prone skin, on a range of skin types and concerns during a <strong>four week period</strong>, then recorded our findings.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But just to set expectations, while these moisturizers are <strong>non-irritating </strong>and work to hydrate without causing flare-ups, they are not necessarily treatments for acne and blemishes. Board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. DiAnne Davis</a> says that the best thing you can do for acne-prone skin is to keep pores clear of gunk and grime but the skin soft and supple. On that note, our winning formulas are ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-tata-harper-clarifying-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1h4s2RZhtmlXMwDgFhOpABgk97M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/clarifying-moisturizer-cf5874ab374e4ab095fc1ddd6bbbdbb8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It kept acne at bay even during our cycles.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a few minutes to fully absorb.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Honey, jojoba seed oil, glycerin<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This moisturizer was specifically formulated with acne-prone skin in mind. Rather than stripping away oils and degrading the skin barrier, Tata Harper uses <strong>soothing and nourishing botanicals </strong>to rebalance and protect<strong> </strong>the skin. We tested their claims and learned that they’re far from lofty. We usually have some breakouts during our period, but since starting this product, <strong>no blemishes appeared</strong> with the arrival of Aunt Flo.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The lotion felt smooth and took a moment to fully sink in (we had to give it a minute or two before applying any other product over it), but in general felt very lightweight and friendly. A waft of botanical scents gently touched our noses but disappeared again almost immediately once absorbed. Most of all, we experienced <strong>no burning sensation</strong> from the ingredients (most of which were derived from nature). After four weeks of daily use, we’re elated to report that we had<strong> far fewer breakouts</strong>. It also helped<strong> reduce redness and puffiness</strong> around the cheeks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-acne-prone-skin-aveeno-clear-complexion-daily-acne-facial-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Acne Facial Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Acne Facial Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8DRvyTVgB2S1yYewz7sc5f1O4_Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aveeno-Clear-Complexion-Daily-Acne-Facial-Moisturizer-edcfd3d8e76a44888b664894022a385d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It reduced our breakouts in severity, frequency, and length.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is a faint oatmeal scent to it which may not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Salicylic acid, soybean seed extract, glycerin<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>4 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For how price-conscious this product is, it worked absolute miracles on our oily and acne-prone skin. Since using this, <strong>our breakouts were not as frequent, severe, or long-lasting.</strong> Not to mention, after the month-long testing period, our skin looked visibly balanced and more hydrated.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The experience of slathering the lotion on was also pleasant. Almost immediately, the product felt <strong>refreshing, light, and comfortable</strong>, spreading without any patchiness. We applied this after going over our skin with a cleanser and the lightweight moisturizer helped block the overproduction of oils. Throughout the day, we could feel our skin singing with gratitude for such special treatment. There is a bit of an <strong>oatmeal scent</strong> to it, which we quite enjoyed but may not be for everyone. Fear not, however, as it never lingered and became undetectable after a few short moments.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-night-biossance-squalane--probiotic-gel-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Night</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hw-oqzGyBxn3xVATC87bBerbIgo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/biossance-squalane---probiotic-gel-moisturizer-af815da3dcad4b21b9f835d66853274c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This cream paired well with other acne-targeted treatments.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We didn’t see it reduce our blemishes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Encapsulated probiotics, bisabolol, squalane | <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We used this product as part of our nightly skincare routine, as we liked to opt for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>moisturizer with SPF </a>during the day (more on that below). Every morning when we woke up, we were elated to<strong> </strong>see how <strong>plump and moisturized</strong> our skin still looked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Applying this product felt like our skin was taking a nice gulp of water — it was <strong>gentle and quick-absorbing</strong>. The texture was something between a gel and a cream, slightly liquidy, and glided over our skin dreamily without ever feeling taut. We layered this formula over a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Differin gel</a> and it paired superbly well together — it never felt as though the moisturizer was hindering the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>acne serums</a> from working their magic. If you use other topical acne-treatment products, this is a great moisturizer to use in tandem.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-before-makeup-cetaphil-gentle-clear-mattifying-acne-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Before Makeup</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cetaphil Gentle Clear Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cetaphil Gentle Clear Mattifying Acne Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/25eAJrcN3G9Ph17ITTs1sKI6tGA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cetaphil-Gentle-Clear-Mattifying-Acne-Moisturizer-13aa63372a59440a8af2ed582d85e76b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has mildly mattifying properties which worked as a great basis for foundations.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a little drying, especially when combined with other acne products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Salicylic acid, butylene glycol, glycerin<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>3<strong> </strong>oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We deemed this an excellent choice for layering underneath makeup due to its <strong>slightly mattifying properties </strong>that serve as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>primer for foundation</a>. The cream that came out was originally thick right out of the squeeze tube but then <strong>felt light and airy </strong>once on the face. It got absorbed almost instantly and felt quite indetectable on our faces. For this reason, it was easy to go straight into our beauty routine without any lead time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will say however that it’s not the most hydrating of options. Especially when combined with other acne products, it felt quite drying at least for the first week as our skin got used to the new product — likely due to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>salicylic acid</a>, a powerful acne fighting ingredient — which the label did warn us about beforehand. Still, it was a great option that worked double duty as a <strong>fragrance-free</strong>, gentle moisturizer and as a base for makeup.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-cosrx-ac-collection-lightweight-soothing-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CosRx AC Collection Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CosRx AC Collection Lightweight Soothing Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xbRQp4Vb0kswkLdD3SPoMoMlaTQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cosrx-ac-collection-lightweight-soothing-moisturizer-2081c6b718ad4a87a0a2fe81bda78da6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a gentle cooling effect that can soothe flare ups.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not hydrating enough for people with dry skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Propolis extract, aloe leaf water, camellia leaf water, glycerin | <strong>Size: </strong>2.7 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The thing that set this option apart from the rest was that it had a <strong>slightly cooling effect </strong>on the skin immediately upon application. It’s not tightening or irritating, but it was a new kind of sensation for us which we could imagine is useful for when there are painful flare ups. The product is <strong>between a gel and a cream</strong> and it’s rather thin without being runny. As someone with dry skin, the lightweight formula was not quite hydrating enough. It would be an excellent choice for the summer, humid days, or <strong>anyone with oily skin,</strong> however. It also made layering makeup on top a breeze. As a matter of fact, it <strong>kept the makeup from running</strong> throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because it cleanses and tightens pores, any kind of acne caused by product build-up was kept at bay. It didn’t necessarily <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>treat old acne scars</a>, but it did <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>prevent new flare ups</a> from occurring.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-spf-dermalogica-clearing-defense-spf30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with SPF</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dermalogica Clearing Defense SPF30</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dermalogica Clearing Defense SPF30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tV2oGtRnIdE_Nth5WqmChdGMQxI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dermalogica-clear-start-clearing-defense-spf30-dce414c2f8db4f2d9f8380169b0d42df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermalogica&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Our tester typically breaks out when applying new products, but this product kept flare ups at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It stings the eye when it gets into it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Homosalate, octocrylene, butylene glycol<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>2 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Where typical sunscreens feel heavy and greasy, this one was thin enough to spread easily and <strong>didn’t clog our pores</strong>. It had a slightly mattifying effect, which made<strong> layering makeup over a breeze</strong>. And while there wasn’t any itching or burning when it covered our acne, it did sting our eyes if it got into them (pro tip: wash your hands after applying the cream before going into your makeup routine).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note is that we did see some separation occurring. A simple shake of the bottle allowed the formula to mix well and came out more consistent. We recommend this product for people with normal to oily, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin</a>, as we noticed it’s more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer. Our tester typically breaks out anytime she applies a new product to her face but this was one of the first times that did not occur.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-mature-skin-dr-barbara-strm-clarifying-face-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Mature Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Barbara Stürm Clarifying Face Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Barbara St&amp;uuml;rm Clarifying Face Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Jh24odQZyBWkl9tSjadsLgdl0dU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dr-Barbara-Sturm-Clarifying-Face-Cream-b398ffa32ecc4d4598b75db5ca806342.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>D.r Barbara Stürm</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It improved the overall hydration level of our skin over time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It has a slight medicinal scent to it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Purslane extract, macadamia nut oil, vitamin C, vitamin E<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0.7 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Barbara Stürm is known for their pricey skincare products and we’ve put them to the test. While using this moisturizer, <strong>we experienced zero breakouts,</strong> despite typically having a few when trying out new products. We’re usually quite wary of creams that claim to be for acne as they have a tendency to dry out our skin and irritate it. This one however was <strong>soft and gentle, </strong>a friendly kiss to the cheek, if you will.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula has a<strong> </strong>medicinal scent to it, which wasn’t a make it or break it detail. It fades in the minutes it takes to fully seep into the skin, however. The cream itself is<strong> very luxurious and lightweight</strong> — a great hot weather option. We noticed with consistent use that our overall skin<strong> hydration improved with time</strong> — we no longer experienced any midday dryness.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-natural-dr-jart-teatreement-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Natural</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Jart+ Teatreement Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Jart+ Teatreement Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/onBflyqznlXBSeosXts6ggsuP6c=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dr.-Jart-Teatreement-Moisturizer-da3196d800b54a699b8f662eafce83e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Jart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It pairs really well with other acne-treatment products.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not a particularly long-lasting cream.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Tea tree leaf extract, glycerin, niacinamide<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This moisturizer leans on the power of three different tea tree extracts that soothe blemish-prone skin without drying them out. Dr. Jart calls it a <strong>natural <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>alternative to benzoyl peroxide</a>,</strong> so anyone with sensitive skin (hello, us) who typically experiences irritation from moisturizers would benefit from this option.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing we noticed was how feathery the formula was. Upon application, it <strong>has a bit of a cooling effect</strong> on the skin <strong>without feeling sticky</strong> or leaving any residue.
