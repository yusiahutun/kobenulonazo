That is because children look up to their parents and will always overlook or dismiss many of the toxic signs of a mother. Besides, a mother does not have to be physically abusive or selfish to be toxic to her children. But when a mother is toxic to her child, it always leads to consequences once the child becomes an adult. So, what are the 8 signs you were raised by a toxic mother without knowing?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7926406fb809b106.png><p class=align-left>If you are old enough, you now realise that your mother was toxic because she showed controlling behaviour. Also, you may have noticed that your mother manipulated you, never showed empathy and support, and gave you unrealistic expectations.</p><p class=align-left>In other cases, your mother tended to compare you to others despite your unique abilities and was unwilling to listen to different points of view. The effects of growing up with a toxic mother always manifest themselves when a child becomes an adult.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d902d9c32e9af4bf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ being a mom isn't easy quotes and messages to encourage you</span></p></a><h2>8 signs you were raised by a toxic mother</h2><p class=align-left>Toxic mothers can have a significant and lasting impact on their children. For example, when a mother is emotionally distant or neglectful to her daughter, the toxic behaviours can affect the daughter in future, whereby she develops feelings of low self-worth, anxiety, depression, and difficulty trusting and relating to other people.</p><h3>1. Challenges expressing your emotions</h3><p class=align-left>Toxic mothers can make their daughters feel ashamed of expressing their emotions, leading to difficulty expressing themselves in future. Generally, if your mother is overly controlling or critical, it can leave you anxious. You will also feel ashamed to express your feelings to people around you.</p><p class=align-left>When a toxic mother does not respond to or validate their child’s emotions, the child may feel like their feelings are unimportant. Mothers need to provide their children with enough guidance and emotional support. If a child lacks the opportunity to identify and express their feelings, they may not healthily express their emotions and feelings once they become adults.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c1ecc89d32086940.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unique gifts for a mom who doesn't want anything from daughter or son</span></p></a><h3>2. Fear of failure</h3><p class=align-left>A toxic mother can instil fear of failure in their daughters, leading them to avoid taking risks and opportunities. One sign you have a toxic mother in adulthood is that she is overly protective and does not allow you to make mistakes. However, the consequence is that you fear failure, preventing you from taking the next steps and moving forward.</p><p class=align-left>When a mother is too critical or harshly punishes a child for making mistakes, it can lead them to develop a fear of failure in adulthood. Such criticism and punishment force their children to believe they cannot succeed independently and that making mistakes is unacceptable. But the <a href=#>world</a> is full of mistakes, and only those that learn from their mistakes grow.</p><h3>3. Inability to trust</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d902d9c32e9af4bf.jpg><p class=align-left>When a girl notices that they are unworthy of being trusted, it could be a sign her mother was toxic when raising her. For example, suppose a mother is inconsistent in her expectations or fails to provide emotional support to her daughter. In that case, the daughter will develop a lack of trust in herself and others. Consequently, the child could have challenges forming <a href=#>new relationships</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84775da1306559b8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 subtle signs of relationship abuse and what you should do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mothers who are also overly controlling or neglectful can create an inability for their daughters to trust. For example, when a mother is too controlling, the child may feel that their autonomy is being taken away, and they may not trust that their mother will allow them to make their own decisions. And when a mother is too neglectful, the daughter may develop a sense of insecurity once she becomes an adult.</p><h3>4. Overcompensating</h3><p class=align-left>One of the signs your mother resents you is you have become overcompensating. For example, mothers try to compensate for their shortcomings by giving their daughters more than they need. Furthermore, they try to take on too many roles in their children’s lives, like acting as both a mother and father.</p><p class=align-left>A mother can also try to buy her child’s love, set too high expectations for him or her, or prevent them from making mistakes and learning from them. When this happens, she is forcing the kid to overcompensate when growing up. Signs your daughter is overcompensating include hiding her shortcomings, talking negatively about other people’s abilities, and excessively focusing on minor accomplishments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5def4a9bdc0e35b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I love you mom quotes and messages from daughter and son</span></p></a><h3>5. Perfectionism</h3><p class=align-left>One of the signs of a toxic mother-daughter relationship is perfectionism. Perfectionism begins when a mother sets high expectations for her daughter. Also, it cultivates itself when a toxic mother constantly pushes her daughter to achieve more than she can.</p><p class=align-left>A mother who is overly critical of her daughter’s mistakes and makes her feel they are good enough is raising their child to become a perfectionist. When the child becomes an adult, she will believe there is no room for making mistakes and will have a specific manner of doing things, whether right or wrong. Also, the child will always think about the result and never care what it takes to achieve the goal.</p><h3>6. Poor decision making</h3><p class=align-left>A toxic mother can contribute to her kid becoming a poor decision-maker in many ways. For example, a mother does not provide guidance and support for her daughter to develop her <a href=#>decision-making abilities</a>. Also, the mother does not give her child enough supervision or feedback when the child is making a decision.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ce5d7a0d3c12e76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wife or mother: who should come first in a man's life?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c1ecc89d32086940.jpg><p class=align-left>Children develop poor decision-making skills when they have a mother focused on being too controlling. As a result, the child feels powerless and cannot voice her opinion, leading her to make poor decisions in adulthood. Finally, a mother who is a poor decision-maker will raise a child who will make poor decisions in the future.</p><h3>7. Poor self-esteem</h3><p class=align-left>It is common to find toxic mothers who often criticise their daughters and make them feel inadequate. Also, some mothers make their daughters feel guilty about expressing their own needs and desires. These traits can make a daughter develop low self-esteem when she grows up.</p><p class=align-left>The daughter will feel trapped and controlled from a younger age. As a result, she will develop <a href=#>unhealthy behavioural patterns,</a> such as people-pleasing and self-sacrifice, to gain approval from others. And once the child feels other people are better than her or says negative things about herself, she has already developed low self-esteem.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop loving the father of your child as a single mom</span></p></a><h3>8. Unhealthy attachment patterns</h3><p class=align-left>Toxic mothers do many things that lead their daughters to develop unhealthy attachment patterns. For example, inconsistent parenting styles, lack of nurturing and support, and insensitivity to a child’s needs can make a child develop unhealthy attachment patterns. Unhealthy attachment patterns can result from a mother's unresolved attachment issues, such as those stemming from her childhood.</p><p class=align-left>Similarly, physical or emotional neglect, abuse, or mental health issues in the mother or her family can lead to unhealthy attachment patterns when a child becomes an adult. As a consequence, the child will have a challenge forming new <a href=#>relationships</a>. She will also struggle to regulate her emotions as she grows up.</p><p class=align-left>Children may not know their mother is toxic when they grow up. They only realise this point in their adulthood when certain things happen to their lives. When you find yourself unable to trust, have challenges expressing emotions, and overcompensate, these are three of 8 signs you were raised by a toxic mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30fb47cab9fc697b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>She stopped texting me out of nowhere! 8 possible reasons why</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about the <a href=#>signs she is pretending to love you </a>but isn’t serious.
