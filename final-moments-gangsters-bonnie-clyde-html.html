'There are certain outlaws that become iconic, like Billy the Kid, Al Capone and others, who live on forever.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Bonnie and Clyde were certainly that, they were both handsome people, were nobodies, and they robbed banks at a time when banks were not loved by everyone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They had eluded capture for many years, their apprehension was strategic and tactical, it worked like a military operation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was planned out to the letter, officers didn't want Bonnie and Clyde to get away and to potentially go on to kill other police officers and civilians.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The previous owner had acquired the photographs from her uncle who worked at the local newspaper at the time of the event.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The images are like a storyboard to a movie, but it reminds you that these were actual people aside from the portrayals and preconceptions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Some of the photographs are gory, they were killed in a horrible manner, but they were killers too - I'm like a doctor and look at them in a clinical way.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'People are intrigued by Bonnie and Clyde and our exhibit at Photographs Do Not Bend was well received.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I am the gallery director but have been a photo collector for things like this and these vintage photographs are really important.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I thought it would be great for our gallery to own them for a while, the exhibit had a larger than money value.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The photographs were on show at 22-year-old gallery Photographs Do Not Bend, which exhibits work from the 20th century, up until recently when they were bought by a private collector.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Several of the images now hang in the home of Thomas Yurkin, 55, from Dallas, Texas, who purchased them after

then.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The other photos show Clyde's arrest warrant, his record, another shows the officers and individuals that ambushed them in Louisiana and I have a couple of the car that they were driving.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'As they were dragged into the city towed by a car, people were cutting off their hair and clothes, one guy was trying to cut off Clyde's ear, another tried to cut off his finger.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I have one image that shows some of their clothing and when they were killed as well as other pictures of them lying on the gurney table.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Bonnie and Clyde were both buried here, Bonnie had 20,000 people show up to her funeral which is pretty amazing for back then it's the equivalent of a celebrity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I have five of the photos up in my house, not the gruesome ones but the images that are more the iconic moments that show their life.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It wasn't long after loved-up pair met in 1930 that Clyde was imprisoned for Grand Theft Auto and lovesick Bonnie helped him to escape from prison by smuggling him a

Clyde died instantly - the first shot took off the top of his head.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Bonnie was only wounded and began screaming - a scream so terrible that their principal pursuer, former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, fired two more shots into the defenceless 23-year old at close range.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I hate to bust the cap on a woman, especially when she was sitting down,' the laconic Hamer said afterwards. 'But if it wouldn't have been her, it would have been us.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their bodies were riddled with 50 bullets each, even though Bonnie Parker had never been charged with a capital offence.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pair had become notorious after two years on the run and the crime scene quickly descended into a bizarre circus.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Three of the posse left to collect the local coroner - but the remaining three allowed souvenir-hunters to swarm over the car.</p><img id=i-47e75e88dcf02c24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/06/12/0000D96B00000CB2-5151347-image-a-41_1512564379759.jpg height=680 width=470 alt="Bonnie Parker holds a shotgun to the midriff of Clyde Barrow, pictured in 1933" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Bonnie Parker holds a shotgun to the midriff of Clyde Barrow, pictured in 1933</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One man tried to cut off Clyde's finger with a pocket knife; another attempted to cut off his left ear. Blood-stained pieces of Bonnie's dress were removed, as were locks of her hair.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When coroner J.L.Wade arrived, he recalled: 'Nearly everyone had begun collecting souvenirs, such as shell casings and slivers of glass from the shattered car windows.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wade asked Hamer to control the crowd, and ensure that the car - complete with the bodies - was taken intact to the local town of Arcadia.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the freak show didn't end there.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the four-door saloon had been towed back to the Conger Furniture Store and Funeral Parlour in Arcadia, and the bodies laid out for examination, the coroner allowed sightseers to view the remains.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Within 12 hours, the town's population had ballooned from just 2,000 to an estimated 12,000, with spectators travelling across the state to see the grisly remains of Bonnie and Clyde - and the price of beer in local bars doubled in price as a result.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But it wasn't just the public who were fascinated by the death of thesetwo outlaws.The lawmen who shot them also wanted their piece ofhistory.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hamer and his men took the arsenal of machine guns, rifles and pistols they found in the car, as well as the 15 false number plates that Clyde used to confuse his pursuers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All were later sold as souvenirs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie Parker's clothes and saxophone, which had also been in the Ford, were taken by the lawmen, too.

Although it had originally been stolen by Bonnie and Clyde from Ruth Warren of Topeka, Kansas, the local Parish Sheriff in Arcadia, Henderson Jordan, a member of Hamer's six-man posse, claimed it as his own.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Warren hired a lawyer to reclaim it and within weeks was renting out the car for £100 a week - a staggering sum in those days - to Charles W. Stanley, who called himself 'The Crime Doctor'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He took it around the country to help plug his popular crime lectures.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Stanley made a fortune out of the fame of Bonnie and Clyde - a fame that was fanned by their funerals. After the bodies had been transported to Dallas, where their families lived, the funeral directors put them on show.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ten thousand people - many of them drunk - turned up to see Clyde Barrow's body before the Dallas police were called to disperse the crowd.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One man even offered Clyde's father £7,500 for the corpse.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie Parker's mother, Emma, estimated that 20,000 people filed past her open casket - although for the most part they remained orderly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pretty Boy Floyd and John Dillinger sent flowers. But amidst all the hype and hoopla, one truth remains.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The myth that has surrounded Bonnie and Clyde since that fateful morning 75 years ago bears little resemblance to reality.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As American reporter John Guinn says in a new book, Bonnie and Clyde were, in fact, 'perhaps the most inept crooks ever'. He calls their two-year crime spree 'as much a reign of error as of terror'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To discover the real Bonnie and Clyde, we need to travel back to those dusty roads of Louisiana and find out how two kids from the slums of West Dallas fell in love and traded their lives for a brief moment of celebrity - transmitted across the world by the new cinema newsreels and photo agencies.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The pictures of Bonnie Parker, for example, with a cigar between her teeth, beret on her head and a pistol in her hand, swept across the U.S, earning her the sobriquet: The Cigar-Smoking Gun Moll.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It made her and Clyde Barrow as famous as baseball player Babe Ruth or film star Mary Pickford.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the reality was quite different.

Clyde walked with a pronounced limp because in 1932 he'd hacked off his left big toe and part of a second toe to get a transfer out of the notoriously tough Eastham Prison Farm in Texas.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, Bonnie's left leg was badly injured in a car accident the same year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was trapped in the car when it burst into flames, and escaping battery acid burned her left leg down to the bone. She could barely walk for the last 18 months of her life,and either hopped everywhere or was carried by Clyde.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their lives certainly weren't glamorous either, spending night after night sleeping in the back of a stolen car hidden deep in the woods and eating cold pork and beans from a tin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even as bank robbers, they were bunglers - and knew it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie and Clyde mainly committed what Guinn calls 'nickel and dime robberies' from ' mom and pop grocery stores and service stations', stealing between $5 and $10 from hardworking people struggling to survive the Depression and the Dust Bowl drought that devastated America's farming heartland.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So how did this young couple come to hypnotise America?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Born in Rowena, Texas, on October 1, 1910, Bonnie Elizabeth Parker was the second of three children born to her bricklayer father Charles, who died when she was just four.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After his death, her destitute mother, Emma, moved the family to the slums of West Dallas, known then as 'the Devil's back porch'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Poor though she was, Bonnie was clever, attractive and strong-willed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At school, she excelled at creative writing, particularly poetry, and rapidly became a warm-up speaker at rallies for local politicians.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She dreamed of becoming a star on Broadway, but nothing materialised, and just before her 16th birthday she married a neighbourhood thug called Roy Thornton.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The couple separated in 1929, but they never divorced, and Bonnie was still wearing Thornton's wedding ring when she died alongside her partner-in-crime five years later.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Born just south of Dallas, on March 24, 1909, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, was the fifth of seven children. His was a poor, farming family, who were forced off their land by the drought.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A car fanatic, he was first arrested in 1926 when police confronted him over a rental car he'd failed to return. His second arrest came with his elder brother Ivan 'Buck' Barrow, when the two were caught stealing turkeys.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The brothers would quickly progress to stealing cars.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Buck would eventually become a member of the bank-robbing Barrow Gang, formed by his younger brother. His wife, Blanche, would also join the gang.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On January 5, 1930, one of Clyde Barrow's friends invited him to a party, where he met Bonnie for the first time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With his dark wavy hair and dancing brown eyes, she was instantly attracted to him. She told friends he had nice clothes 'and fancy cars', even if she knew they might be stolen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie's mother said later: 'As crazy as she'd been about Roy, she never worshipped him as she did Clyde.' The gangster love story that was to enthrall a nation had begun.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Less than two months after their meeting, Clyde was arrested and spent the next two years in jail, some of it at Eastham Prison Farm.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prison life did not treat the diminutive Barrow kindly: he was repeatedly beaten up and sodomised by fellow inmate Ed Crowder.</p><img id=i-9f1ce5f691583d53 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/06/12/03EC7575000003E8-5151347-image-m-45_1512564499508.jpg height=676 width=470 alt="Clyde holds up Bonnie in front of a car in a picture thought to have been taken in 1933&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Clyde holds up Bonnie in front of a car in a picture thought to have been taken in 1933&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In late October 1931, Clyde responded by beating Crowder to death with an iron pipe - his first killing. But a fellow prisoner, already serving life for murder, confessed to the crime as a favour and Clyde was never even charged.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the end of January the following year, Barrow took an axe to his toes in an effort to escape the brutal regime at Eastham. Ironically, he was paroled just five days later.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Reunited with Bonnie, Clyde resolved never to return to jail and, to take revenge on the Texas prison system, vowed to organise a jail-break from Eastham.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the next two years, Bonnie and Clyde's haphazard exploits became ever more dramatic, as small-scale robberies led to desperate attempts on banks, and the Barrow Gang roamed across five rural states.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their attempts to make big money were at times laughable, though. One risky bank bust saw them get away with just $1.75.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite this, 'America thrilled to their Robin Hood adventures', in the words of one columnist. 'The presence of a female, Bonnie, escalated the sincerity of their intentions to make them something unique and individual - even at times heroic.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The gang usually kidnapped, rather than killed, any lawmen they encountered, releasing them with the money to get home - which only helped to fuel their celebrity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But there was nothing heroic about their gang's escape when they were surrounded by police at a motel near Kansas City in July 1933.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They blasted their way out using Clyde's favoured Browning Automatic Rifles, but Clyde's elder brother Buck was shot and injured, while Buck's wife, Blanche, was all but blinded by flying glass.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Six days later, they were surrounded again at an abandoned amusement park near Dexter, Iowa.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bonnie and Clyde escaped, but Buck was shot in the back and Blanche was again hit by flying glass. Buck died five days later.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Increasingly desperate, Clyde sought reinforcements by organising a break- out from Eastham Prison Farm in January 1934, releasing at least four prisoners, three of whom joined his gang.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But during the jailbreak, a guard was killed, which brought the full weight of Texas law enforcement down on the Barrow Gang. Former Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer was charged with catching Bonnie and Clyde - for a fee.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Before he could do so, however, Clyde and one of the prisoners he'd released, Henry Methven, killed two highway patrolmen in Southlake, Texas, on April 1, 1934.</p><img id=i-596b1c18609de0ef src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/12/06/13/470BAD2900000578-5151347-image-a-51_1512567533981.jpg height=766 width=962 alt="A mugshot of Clyde Barrow.
