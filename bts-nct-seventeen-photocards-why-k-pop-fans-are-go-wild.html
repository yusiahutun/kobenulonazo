The white border cards tended to sell for around US$60 to US$100 in 2012, and the ones that you can still find floating around these days sell for almost as much, if not more.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most Crabb has ever spent on a photocard was US$165 for one featuring T-ara’s Jiyeon which came with the band’s 2014 Season’s Greetings Calendar. That same week, she saw the same card sell for US$300.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/10/d6ccd811-b86a-415c-862b-ca7d6f7e3b81_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While many fans collect photocards from many artists, Nicole Tacos, a 26-year-old fan in San Diego, California, only hunts for a specific group of stars, partially because it would be overwhelming to focus on many artists or try to get sets of photocards for any K-pop groups as a whole.</p>Currently, Tacos is collecting cards featuring <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Ateez’s</span></a> Yunho, Stray Kids’ Bang Chan, Seventeen’s S.Coups, and NCT’s Yuta.&nbsp;<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What keeps me collecting is the satisfying feeling of seeing your favourite member from each era of their career. It’s a type of memorabilia for me. Music is a huge part of my life and K-pop was a very significant part of a milestone in my life.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/10/ff2d6a58-cb5d-44bb-9295-027426e8a28b_d7825e71.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lex Armstrong, a 28-year-old Canadian fan, has more than 1,000 photocards. Armstrong pre-orders albums to get the cards she wants. “I keep collecting because I enjoy the community I’ve found with sellers and enjoy hunting down rare cards.”&nbsp;</p>As a massage therapist and student, Armstrong undertook a costly – but worthwhile – endeavour to track down a full set of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">NCT and SuperM member Taeyong’s</span></a> photocards, but now that she&nbsp;has them all, she’s able to focus on getting future releases, which are a lot more affordable.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Kimberly Gutierrez, a 19-year-old BTS fan in California, the dedication, time and money spent on acquiring photocards are a representation of what K-pop has done for her since she discovered BTS while experiencing depression.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/10/3669591f-d205-4c6a-9a56-608429f44580_2cc56b3b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was the best decision I ever made,” Gutierrez said. “They saved my life. I was going to commit suicide but listening to BTS made me happy and want to keep living. I have never been happier than I am now with collecting photocards and listening to K-pop.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amber Ali, a 24-year-old from Texas, is nicknamed the “Monsta X Photocardologist” by friends, and currently owns 375 photocards. Ali has been collecting for several years, and has some advice for new collectors after once accidentally buying a rare card for US$213 because of a misunderstanding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of new fans have started collecting and I just want to give some advice. Never panic buy something for a ridiculous price. Just have patience, because people will always be selling the items you’re looking for. Something you can afford will come by soon enough.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Also, collecting should be fun. If you’re stressing over anything, take a step back. Collecting should be happy and fun, not stressful and expensive.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/10/7731d04e-0d5f-4d72-9ed9-96a539b4b967_d2e0237f.jpg>Terrica Mathis, a 29-year-old in Austin, Texas, began collecting in July 2020 and already has about 200 photocards. Mathis quickly learned about the intensity of the world, and often buys or sells cards on secondary selling sites such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Depop</span></a> or Japanese e-retailer Mercari, or on social media sites including Twitter and Instagram.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I know there are people who collect baseball and basketball trading cards, but I believe K-pop fans have found a way to put their own twist on buying and trading cards,” said Mathis.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From the decorative binders, to the way fans connect with each other, collecting photocards has become a huge part of K-pop fandom culture. Collecting has its own rules, etiquette, and even its own language. It is really cool to see the process of buying and trading, and sharing your collection with others.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, Mathis – an NCT fan whose most prized photocards are a set of NCT Dream cards from their “We Young” album – explained that “WTS” means “willing to sell” and&nbsp;“QYOP” means “quote your own price”.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/10/0ee422a6-607f-4ab3-a331-f6a767305411_ed834fd2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said there were professional sellers who hunted photocards, especially autographed or rarer ones, from South Korean sellers and sold them to international fans. They also act as middle men and have sizeable followings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other fans also shared that “member pricing”, or re-sellers amping up the prices of certain cards based on the popularity of a certain member of a group in comparison to how much they’re selling other members’ cards for, is increasingly a common frustration for photocard collectors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The inflation of prices is getting a little ridiculous to the point where members of certain groups are speaking out about it and even going as far as sharing their photocard pictures on social media for those who cannot afford them,” Mathis said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lesley Kahinga, a 21-year-old American collector, likes buying albums to get photocards and she only keeps those featuring her biases (K-pop fandom lingo for her favourite K-pop stars).&nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong collector buys rare Pokemon trading card</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kahinga is now being more selective about spending money. Although her&nbsp;favourite card is one featuring Taeyong with blue hair from a SuperM album, she’s reconsidering her spending habits and thinks others might be as well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I get my photocards from albums and have bought some on eBbay. My rare Taeyong card, for example, is from [SuperM’s] first mini album and if I wanted to pull another I would have to purchase 20 to 30 albums instead of just buying one online.”&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Margaret Harton, a 33-year-old fan who travels back and forth between California and Jakarta in Indonesia, has a fun rule for how much she’ll<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"> </strong>spend, which helps her feel better about her expensive hobby, which she funds with her job in fashion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I try not to go past US$88.&nbsp;So far the most I have paid was US$80 plus shipping, which&nbsp;came to precisely US$88. And why 88? Eight is a lucky number in Chinese, so doubling that is like double the luck.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkGtoa3FoZK%2B1v4ynmq1lo5rDprrTnpynZaCdvLW7wpqpnatdrLW6ecpmp6ioXZuur7%2BMmqmeZZekeri1y50%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbts-nct-seventeen-photocards-why-k-pop-fans-are-go-wild.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbts-nct-seventeen-photocards-why-k-pop-fans-are-go-wild.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbts-nct-seventeen-photocards-why-k-pop-fans-are-go-wild.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbts-nct-seventeen-photocards-why-k-pop-fans-are-go-wild.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbts-nct-seventeen-photocards-why-k-pop-fans-are-go-wild.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbts-nct-seventeen-photocards-why-k-pop-fans-are-go-wild.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./oscar-winning-la-confidential-director-curtis-hanson-71-dies-home-suspected-heart-attack-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./oscar-winning-la-confidential-director-curtis-hanson-71-dies-home-suspected-heart-attack-html.html>Oscar-winning LA Confidential director Curtis Hanson 'dies of suspected heart attack'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chael-sonnen-tito-ortiz-bellator-170-rolls-royce.html>Chael Sonnen &amp;amp; Tito Ortiz's Hilarious Violent Trash Talk</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chael-sonnen-tito-ortiz-bellator-170-rolls-royce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
