<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Although hard to believe, Vin Diesel has a twin brother, who may not be as famous, but has a part in bringing some significant movie projects to life.</strong></p><p>Fans are all too familiar with the friendship between late actor Paul Walker and his “Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel. In fact, their friendship graduated into a rare brotherhood over time, so much so that Diesel walked Walker’s daughter, Meadow, down the aisle in his stead.</p><p>While the brotherhood between the costars has been celebrated for years, what many did not know is that Diesel has not one, but two biological brothers in real life. One of his brothers happens to be his twin, who may not share his physical features but is a reflection of the actor’s familial roots all the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Newstoter_com-Black-News-and-Entertainment-Portal-1-jpeg.webp><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_The_Twin_Brother_Of_Vin_Diesel></span><strong>Who Is The Twin Brother Of Vin Diesel?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although he strives to keep his personal life away from the spotlight, Vin Diesel has a twin brother who goes by the name, <a href=#>Paul Vincent Sinclair</a>. Like Diesel, his twin brother came into the world on July 18, 1967.</p><p>Born in Alameda, California to Delora Sherleen and an unidentified biological dad, the brothers grew up with their mom and stepfather, Irving H. Sinclair.</p><p>Having married their mom, their stepfather adopted them and gave them his last name, Sinclair. Unlike Diesel who ditched his last name for a stage name, his bother still goes by that last name to date.</p><p>Owing to their adoptive dad’s career as an acting teacher and theatre manager, Vin Diesel and his twin brother grew up developing a passion for the arts. However, while Diesel pursued acting, Paul Vincent was more interested in working behind the scenes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Paul_Vincents_Career_And_Net_Worth></span><strong>Paul Vincent’s Career And Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Vin-Diesels-Twin-Brother-Paul-Vincent-Looks-Nothing-Like-Him-_-eCelebrityBabies-1-1.png><p>Vin Diesel’s twin brother Paul Vincent Sinclair also works in entertainment. Unlike his brother, who rose to fame as the star of movies like “Fast Five,” “Fast and Furious,” “Riddick,” “The Last Witch Hunter,” and “Bloodshot,” Vincent <a href=#>works</a> behind the scenes as a sound engineer.</p><p>He has also collaborated with Diesel on <a href=#>films</a> like “Fast and Furious,” and “Multi-Facial.” However, since his roles in these hit movies are usually behind the scenes, the 56-year-old has done a great job staying away from the spotlight.</p><p>Notwithstanding, he has managed to build an impressive net worth for himself over time. Today, Paul Vincent is worth an estimated $1.2 million per <a href=#>abtc.ng</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vincents_Personal_Life></span><strong>Vincent’s Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Paul Vincent seems to have taken after his brother’s penchant for keeping his personal life away from the public eye.</p><p>Little information about Vincent’s private life, family, kids, and relationships is known to the public. Meanwhile, his twin brother hasn’t had much luck when it comes to keeping his romance off the radars. Reports of Diesel’s relationship with longtime girlfriend and Spanish model Paloma Jimenez have surfaced. The two began dating in 2007 and have three kids together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vin_Diesel_Has_Two_Other_Siblings></span><strong>Vin Diesel Has Two Other Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aside from his twin brother, Vin Diesel has two other <a href=#>siblings</a>, including a sister, Samantha, and a brother, Tim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Did-You-Know-Vin-Diesels-Sister-Samantha-Vincent-Is-A-Producer_-_-eCelebrityBabies-1.png><p>The two have reportedly found success in their chosen careers, with Tim maintaining a scheduled life, while Samanta has a career in the movie industry. Some of her movie credits include “Riddick,” and “Fast Five.”</p><p>Her works in entertainment earned her the Bronze Lens Festival’s Vanguard Superstar Award in 2018. Samantha’s career excellence proves that talent indeed runs in the family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02atoqZdmbamv8Slqmasp567bq7RqKuhnaJivaLBy2auoaddlrm0u4yhmKxlkWKwor7EnqlmoZ5itbC4y7KuqKeUYrCivsSeqWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-vin-diesels-twin-brother-paul-who-also-has-a-career-in-hollywood-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-vin-diesels-twin-brother-paul-who-also-has-a-career-in-hollywood-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-vin-diesels-twin-brother-paul-who-also-has-a-career-in-hollywood-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-vin-diesels-twin-brother-paul-who-also-has-a-career-in-hollywood-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-vin-diesels-twin-brother-paul-who-also-has-a-career-in-hollywood-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-vin-diesels-twin-brother-paul-who-also-has-a-career-in-hollywood-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20091008918.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20091008918.html>Melissa Leo - Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brigit-mahoney-bio-height-age-married-ryan-ferguson.html>Meet Brigit Mahoney!
