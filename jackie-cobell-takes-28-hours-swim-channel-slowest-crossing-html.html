That was why she did it. Quite how was another matter entirely.<br></span></p><p><span>‘I don’t really know myself,’ she said yesterday. ‘I just kept thinking of all the people I’d be letting down if I stopped.’<br></span></p><p><span>Mrs Cobell, a council foster carer from Tonbridge, Kent, was nicknamed Flipper at school because she took to the water so well. But after bringing up daughters Sarah, 32, and Victoria, 30, she started to gain weight and at one stage tipped the scales at 20 stone.<br></span></p><p><span>Five years ago she took up swimming again and decided to prepare for the Channel challenge to lose weight. She became much fitter – but, despite intensive training, no slimmer. So she had a gastric bypass operation in November and shed eight stone in as many months.<br></span></p><p><span>Then came the big swim.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/27/article-0-0A95E72A000005DC-373_634x442.jpg height=442 width=634 alt="Jackie Cobell" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jackie Cobell two years ago, when she was training for her swim in a bid to shift some of her 20 stone weight. She has since has a gastric band and shed eight stone</p><p><span>‘I practised on Windermere,’ she said. ‘It’s about half the distance of the Channel so I just doubled it, added some extra time, and worked out I could probably get to Calais in about 16 hours.’<br></span></p><p><span>A 36ft support boat crewed by a pilot, her husband David, trainer, official observer and friend sailed alongside her.<br></span></p><p><span>But soon after leaving Dover a strong tide dragged her south instead of east. Then it took her north... south again... northeast... south-west... and, eventually, subsided to allow her to carry on eastwards.<br></span></p><p><span>At one stage she came perilously close to collision with a tanker. Then, after less than eight hours, her left arm packed up from an earlier injury and left her swimming for a time like a rowing boat with only one oar.<br></span></p><p><span>Mrs Cobell kept going with the help of a powdered energy drink mixed with water, handed to her from the boat and swigged as she turned on her back and propelled herself with her legs.<br></span></p><p><span>‘It tasted absolutely revolting,’ she said. ‘At one point I was swimming parallel with the coast instead of towards it, which I knew wasn’t right.<br></span></p><p><span>'Every time I caught a glimpse of shore I thought I’d nearly made it. Then the tide would sweep me in another direction. I sang to keep myself going – “Keep on Running” [A No 1 hit for the Spencer Davis Group in 1965] – but I changed the lyrics to Keep On Swimming.<br></span></p><p><span>‘When they told me I was a record breaker I thought they were just having a joke – until I realise it was the record for the slowest crossing.’<br></span></p><p><span>Would she do it again? ‘I think I might need a rest first,’ she said. ‘My arms ache like mad and my ribs are black and blue from crashing against the waves all that time. But maybe next time I might be a bit quicker.’</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4WXaWptZ3qWsKy1xGZ6qJqVobluwMCknKxlYm16qbvUq6pmq6eeum6Px5qlp52cYsCtu9aeqq1lk6e8tL%2FIp55noKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjackie-cobell-takes-28-hours-swim-channel-slowest-crossing-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjackie-cobell-takes-28-hours-swim-channel-slowest-crossing-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjackie-cobell-takes-28-hours-swim-channel-slowest-crossing-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjackie-cobell-takes-28-hours-swim-channel-slowest-crossing-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjackie-cobell-takes-28-hours-swim-channel-slowest-crossing-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjackie-cobell-takes-28-hours-swim-channel-slowest-crossing-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sony-atv-music-publishing-nashville-names-anna-weisband-vp-creative.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sony-atv-music-publishing-nashville-names-anna-weisband-vp-creative.html>Sony/ATV Music Publishing Nashville Names Anna Weisband VP Creative</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fbi-probes-california-officers-called-black-people-monkeys-threatened-shoot-city-mayor-html.html>FBI probes California officers who called black people 'monkeys' and threatened to shoot city mayor</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fbi-probes-california-officers-called-black-people-monkeys-threatened-shoot-city-mayor-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
