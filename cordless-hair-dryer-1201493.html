However, high-wattage dryers (200-400 W) are ideal for styling and a sustainable option over professional corded dryers. 80-100 W is perfect if you want to use a dryer for kids, pets, cleaning, etc.</p><p><strong>Recharge Time:</strong> 50 minutes full recharge time makes the cordless hair dryer incredibly efficient. Avoid investing in hair dryers that require overnight recharge if you prioritize energy consumption.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>Lightweight, sleek and travel-friendly designs are ideal for cordless hair dryers. If the holding body of the dryer is too bulky, it will likely cause fatigue in your hand. So, choose dryers that you can conveniently hold.</p><p><strong>Use:</strong> Most cordless dryers are easy to use and readily assembled. Look for devices with single switch heat settings, in-built rechargeable batteries, detachable filters, and nozzles for convenient use.</p><p><strong>Dryer Attachments:</strong> For various styling purposes, look for devices with detachable concentrators and diffusers. Rotating magnetic nozzles are the cherry on the cake as they allow better angles for airflow.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Built-in batteries are the most convenient choice. Ensure the batteries are leak-proof and endure long hours. Opt for rechargeable batteries over disposable ones.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Good-quality cordless dryers are often expensive as the technology is fairly new. $80 to $170 is a good price range. Nonetheless, make a purchase only if you’re confident about the product’s features.</p><p>If you travel frequently or simply prioritize style at convenience, then cordless hair dryers are a good investment. They are gentler and less efficient than regular corded dryers, hence you should keep your requirements and priorities in mind before shopping. With our above-mentioned product recommendations and buying tips, you can get a fair idea of what to expect from a cordless hair dryer. Ensure the product meets those expectations when you make a purchase. Happy shopping!</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>How long do the batteries last in the cordless hair dryers?</p><p>Built-in batteries in good-quality rechargeable cordless hair dryers ideally last for 3-4 hours. Disposable batteries should sustain a good few weeks.</p><p>Are cordless hair dryers necessary for hair care?</p><p>Cordless hair dryers are gentle on the hair follicles and scalp, which prevents damage and provide soft and shiny hair. While not a hair care essential, they are a good investment for styling convenience.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Hair dryers are the ultimate staple in our haircare kit without any doubt.
