Your husband might browse other women online for a variety of reasons. But how best can you handle the situation?</p><h2>What does it mean if my husband looks at other females on Instagram?</h2><p class=align-left>Screaming and demanding to know why they're looking at other women is not likely to get an honest response. Reacting this way could make your husband feel embarrassed and defensive and yell right back at you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e1626c7a980deebd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys text less after a while? 5 most common reasons</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Instead of verbally attacking him, try and ask him what's going on. Start with being curious and ask, why are you doing this? This way, you are simply allowing your husband to share what is going on. So, what should you do if your husband looks at other females online?</p><h3>1. Pay attention to what he's doing</h3><p class=align-left>Make sure you know exactly what he's doing. Which women are these? Are they his friends or colleagues? Start with what you know is going on, and see if you can discover more.</p><h3>2. Bring your concerns out into the open with him</h3><p class=align-left>Talk to him about what he's been doing and tell him how you feel when you observe him staring at other ladies online. If he's also connecting with them via social media, texting, or chat rooms, tell him what you know and what it means to you.</p><h3>3. Empathize and look deeper</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 tell-tale signs she has moved on to someone else already</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e1626c7a980deebd.jpg><p class=align-left>If he's sincerely regretful for how his behaviour has affected you, it's simpler to empathize with him and show genuine care for what he believes is missing in your marriage. Ask him to be honest about what he's seeking with these ladies he's not getting with you. Does he think you no longer care about him? Or is he interested in something you would prefer not to do?</p><h3>4. Ask him if he's willing to stop</h3><p class=align-left>There is hope for the relationship if he admits that his actions are improper and agrees to change them. But mere words fall short. Know for sure that he won't be tempted to revert to previous behaviours by asking him what he's willing to do.</p><p class=align-left>It's time to face the possibility that your marriage is already over if he is unwilling to stop ogling other women and you even catch him doing more than that. There is hope if he offers a genuine apology (as opposed to a fake "I'm sorry you feel that way" response) and follows it up with deeds.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>5. Know when to end things</h3><p class=align-left>It's time to think about doing something more serious and long-lasting if your husband won't completely cease his weird and inappropriate behaviour toward other women—or if he agrees to stop but then keeps doing it behind your back.</p><h2>What does it mean when your husband looks at another woman online?</h2><p class=align-left>There may be a million things going through your head, but most of them may be insecure thoughts about your relationship. Before you text your <a href=#>best friend</a> something like, "My boyfriend looks at other females online, he's definitely bored of me, right?", take a moment to find out what the reasons could be.</p><p class=align-left>So, Is it normal for guys to look at other pictures of females online?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is normal for a woman to find her husband looking at other females on Instagram and normal for guys to do so.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are a variety of reasons why your husband might be stalking other women on Instagram, from the simple like finding gift ideas to the more sinister like having an addiction to admiring attractive women. Even though your husband's behaviour may be upsetting, there is a way to fix this issue.</p><h2>My husband likes other girls' Instagram posts and not mine</h2><p class=align-left>Men who do this have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">no concept</a> of what it's like when women are <a href=#>filled with jealousy</a> when they find their husbands looking at younger women on Instagram. They simply understand that they are in a position of power in the relationship and may act any way they choose as a result.</p><p class=align-left>It might be really unpleasant to learn that your lover is liking photos of other ladies. You can get the impression that your boyfriend doesn't value you as his girlfriend and is pining after someone else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His careless actions may negatively impact you. So much so that it has an impact on your self-worth and causes you to lose faith in your talents. With all the cheating going on in the world, it would be naïve to trust someone who puts very little effort into earning your confidence. This is not to suggest that every male who likes other women's photos on <a href=#>social media</a> can't be trusted. So, find out why he's doing so, and try to fix it.</p><p class=align-left>If you are ever in a position where you start saying, "My husband looks at other females on Instagram, use the above-mentioned ways to try and solve the issue with your husband.
