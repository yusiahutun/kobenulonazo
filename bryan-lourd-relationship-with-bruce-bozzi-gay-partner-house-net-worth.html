Other high-profile actors he has directed or still directs include Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Alejandro Inarritu, Darren Aronofsky, and Spike Jonze.</p><p>Bryan Lourd has also contributed immensely to the growth and expansion of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) by promoting key partnerships such as the partnership with equity firm TPG, which owns more than 50% of the agency, and its expansion into the world of sports, which led to the creation of the CAA sports division.</p><p>He has also been involved in two major talent deals over the last ten years, where film star Johnny Depp, who has spent most of his career with UTA, was signed for the CAA. The other A-lister who was signed was Ryan Gosling, who was not represented by a major agency or agent for several years. Recently, Lourd finally convinced David Letterman to participate in six episodes of Netflix instead of his earlier decision to retire.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sonya Curry’s Family Life and How She Positively Used Her Racism Experiences</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bryan Lourd Bio</strong></h2><p>Bryan Lourd is commonly known as the Hollywood Power Agent. He was born in New Iberia, Louisiana, USA, on November 5, 1960, the son of parents Sherion Brice and Harvey .H. Lourd, and was given the name Bryan William Lourd.</p><p>Bryan Lourd grew up in his hometown alongside his sibling Blaine Lourd, who is now an investment advisor.

The couple had their first child in 1992, Bille Lourd, but unfortunately were unable to have any more children when their marriage broke up in 1994. The separation was painful for Carrie, who felt betrayed by Bryan and spoke about it publicly. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times about a book she was writing, she revealed that the book prolonged the misery of her separation because it constantly reminded her that she had a child to raise alone and it was a reminder of her broken childhood days. A reflection of what she went through as a child whose parents were divorced was confronted by her daughter. She suffered from severe emotional and psychological disorders due to the separation, which led her to publicly advocate for people with such disorders.</p><p>However, Carrie died of cardiac arrest on 27 December 2016 on a flight from London to Los Angeles.</p><p>After his separation from Carrie, Bryan revealed himself to be gay and on October 12, 2016, he made an alliance with his lover Bruce Bozzi, co-owner of The Plam</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Fetty Wap: What happened To His Eyes?
