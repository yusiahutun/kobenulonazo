A lot of guys buy rental property. I invest in cars. I love them. I think they are works of art.’</p><br><p class=mol-para-with-font>There were times in the past few years when it was tempting to think of Poulter as a museum piece, too.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The memories of his Ryder Cup glories at Medinah and the sartorial adventures of his prime had begun to fade, he had just turned 40 and struggles with injury saw his world ranking plummet. Some began to wonder whether he might even be contemplating retirement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Those thoughts had been dispelled long before he found himself at the top of the leaderboard midway through the second day of the US Masters, playing with Tiger Woods in one of the leading groups on Saturday, finishing his round with a birdie and ending the day tied for fifth and still in the hunt for the Green Jacket.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For one afternoon in Augusta, it really was just him and Tiger.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Poulter is as irrepressible as ever and it was evident as he sat surrounded by his memorabilia in Orlando that he has become a study of a sportsman at peace with himself in the autumn of his career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img id=i-fe7e75fbb0313b70 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/13/21/12238630-0-image-a-36_1555187262688.jpg height=514 width=634 alt="Poulter has a dozen Ferraris in his front room at his Florida mansion ¿ they are his passion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Poulter has a dozen Ferraris in his front room at his Florida mansion – they are his passion</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I feel pretty content that I have done a damn good job from where I came from,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He is 43 now and life is coming at him fast. He is a father of four kids who are growing up quickly.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His eldest daughter, Aimee, 17, is preparing to go to college in the States and his elder son, Luke, 14, wants to be a professional golfer.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Poulter is curious about whether a privileged childhood in a gated community will have robbed his boy of the desire his dad always possessed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When you grow up without stuff and then you get older and have some success, you enjoy the nice things in life because you didn’t as a kid,’ said Poulter.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You want your kids to enjoy the nice things you never had. You spoil them but you have also got to somehow keep their feet on the ground about what is real and what is not real.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Living within these gates is not real but it’s hard because you want your kids driving a nice car; you want them with the things you could never have.

He is not a man haunted by regret. He is not tortured by the memory of near misses.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He has achieved more than he ever thought he would achieve and he is confident there is more to come. ‘I’m catching up with the grey hairs,’ he said, ‘but I don’t feel 43. I am definitely mentally not 43.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His career also asks questions about the criteria we apply to greatness in golf. Some feel it is dependent on winning a major.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Poulter, who has a second and a third at the Open to his name, has achieved so much in the Ryder Cup and has sustained a career at the top for so long against the odds that he has earned more affection than many of his more decorated opponents.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His recovery began when he finished second at the Players’ Championship in 2017, then won for the first time in six years at the Houston Open last year, made the European Ryder Cup team that was victorious in Paris last September and started this season with four top-six finishes.</p><img id=i-7c601d23bb6fdf61 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/13/21/12239174-0-image-a-46_1555188414129.jpg height=434 width=634 alt="He'd still love to win a major&nbsp;but he doesn't feel his career would be incomplete if it eludes him" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>He'd still love to win a major&nbsp;but he doesn't feel his career would be incomplete if it eludes him</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Next year will be his 20th on the European Tour.

I am still playing good golf. If I won a major, it would be the icing on the cake.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His tilt at the Masters brought that dream back to life this week.
