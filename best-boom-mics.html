While the term originated in the film industry for mics used to pick up audio on a set, these days, people also use the term to mean a desk-mounted type.</p><p>The first thing to consider for a desk-mounted boom mic is whether to opt for a <a href=#>USB or XLR microphone</a>. USB microphones are easier to use, as you don't need an <a href=#>audio interface</a> to use them. On the other hand, you have much more to choose from if you opt for an <a href=#>XLR microphone</a>, though you'll need an interface to get the audio into your computer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Second, you'll want to consider the pickup pattern. Whether you're talking about film-style or desk-mounted boom mics, the most popular pickup pattern is cardioid, which focuses on audio directly in front of the microphone capsule. Some desk-mounted boom mics might even use a <a href=#>supercardioid pickup pattern</a>, which is even more directional.</p><p>There are some extra considerations if you want to use your boom microphone for streaming. While the aesthetics of a microphone mean nothing when it comes to audio quality, this may be something to consider when the microphone is always going to be on-screen.</p><p>You'll also want to consider the boom arm you use for a desk-mounted microphone. While many broadcast-style microphones meant for streaming include a boom arm, not all do, and the included models aren't always the highest quality. You can always buy a separate boom arm; we even have a pick for one of our favorites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This article mainly focuses on desk-mounted boom mics for streaming, podcasting, and videoconferencing. That said, if you're a budding filmmaker, we also have a pick for film use. Just make sure to keep in mind that these mics are typically meant for more professional environments and may have requirements like <a href=#>phantom power</a>.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>16</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>5</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>22</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Shure SM7B</a> is a broadcast mainstay, but it's also been used for vocals on countless legendary recordings.</p><p>The SM7B is an XLR mic, so you'll need an audio interface to use it with your computer. It's also a tougher microphone to gain stage properly (Shure recommends at least 60dB of gain), so you'll want to ensure that your interface <a href=#>preamps</a> have plenty of power. If your interface isn't very powerful but does support phantom power, you can use a device like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Cloudlifter CL-1</a> for extra gain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You're good to go once you've got enough gain to record the microphone properly. If you've ever heard a radio announcer or podcast host, chances are good that they were speaking through an SM7B. An onboard high-pass filter keeps the low rumbling from handy noise at bay, while a midrange frequency boost switch can make certain voices pop better.</p><p>You won't get a boom arm with the Shure SM7B. While you'll find bundles available occasionally, there is no official boom arm for the SM7B, so you'll have to choose your own or go with our <a href=#>boom arm pick</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for something like the SM7B but don't want to deal with an audio interface and XLR cables, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Shure MV7</a> is similar but more affordable and uses a USB connection instead of XLR.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rode-ntg-2.jpg> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Shure SM7B</h5><span>Best Boom Mic Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>If you take your podcasting or streaming seriously, the Shure SM7B is a great sounding and reliable pro-level mic that you'll likely never need to upgrade from.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at amazon</a><h2 id=best-budget-boom-mic-nzxt-capsule-mini>Best Budget Boom Mic: <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">NZXT Capsule Mini</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>✓ USB connection makes getting started easy</p></td><td><p>✗ Plastic body feels somewhat fragile</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>✓ Sturdy included desk mount</p></td><td><p>✗ Boom arm is a separate purchase</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>✓ Optional boom arm is great for the price</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>✓ Sleek look in black or white</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finding a mic you can place on a boom arm at a budget price is easy, but finding an affordable mic and boom arm combo is much more difficult. The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">NZXT Capsule Mini</a> is a great affordable boom mic option, as it has an affordable companion in the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">NZXT Boom Arm Mini</a>, and both together cost less than our favorite <a href=#>overall pick</a>.</p><p>This is a USB microphone, which is better for your budget since you don't need to invest in an audio interface on top of it. It also simplifies recording or streaming since you only need to plug it in and go. The microphone supports recordings up to 24-bit/48kHz, perfect for podcasting or streaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The NZXT Capsule Mini is, as the name implies, on the small side. This means it's portable and stays out of the way, even when you include the stand that comes along with the mic. This is especially useful if you're on a budget since you can buy the microphone to make sure you like it and use the stand as a stopgap, upgrading to the boom arm later if you like the microphone.</p><p>While it isn't part of the package, the <a href=#>NZXT Boom Arm Mini</a> is intended as a companion to the Capsule Mini. Funnily enough, the boom arm is built more sturdy than the microphone itself, so if you opt for the boom arm, you may have it around long after you've upgraded to a better mic, as it can sometimes feel flimsy (as we learned in our <a href=#>NZXT Capture Mini review</a>):</p><p>As impressive as the design of the Capsule Mini is, it feels somewhat disconcertingly light. I don't expect a cast metal body on a microphone that retails for well under $100, but at the same time, the plastic here feels on the flimsy side. If you're only setting up the microphone once and leaving it, this won't be an issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Strangely enough, the Capsule Mini and Boom Arm Mini are hard to find packaged together. Still, they're affordable enough to buy both for less than many comparable packages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/52775264975_f5f1f67264_o.jpg> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>NZXT Capsule Mini</h5><span>Best Budget Boom Mic</span><p class=display-card-description>The NZXT Capsule Mini is an affordable mic with a sleek look and solid sound quality.

While it's a great microphone, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Rode NTG-2</a> is considered 'budget' mainly because much of its competition costs thousands. The NTG-2 might be a budget option compared to high-end industry standards, but it's still got plenty to offer indie filmmakers.</p><p>Despite the comparatively low price, this mic means business, so you won't find any USB connectivity here. This is an XLR microphone, so you'll need an audio interface, a separate audio recorder, or a camera capable of working with XLR microphones, either directly or via an adapter. The NTG-2 also requires power, but it can use phantom or battery power.</p><p>One complication of the battery power option is that there isn't an on/off switch for the microphone. This means that if you want to preserve the life of the AA battery, you'll need to remove it when you're not using the microphone. This is mainly just an inconvenience, but still one worth mentioning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The microphone is relatively barebones, delivering solid audio without much required in the way of setup. There is a single switch on the microphone that rolls off low frequencies. If you're filming in a busier area, this is a great way to reduce the background noise of trucks and other noisy vehicles. It also helps to prevent rumbles from wind noise.</p><p>In the standard package, you get the Rode NTG-2, a windscreen, and a standard mount. This will usually work, but Rode offers a few alternative kits. You can buy the NTG-2 with a deluxe windscreen or another version with a shock mount.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rode-psa1.jpg> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Rode NTG-2</h5><span>Best Boom Mic for Filmmaking</span><p class=display-card-description>The Rode NTG-2 isn't exactly cheap, but it's shockingly affordable when compared to most boom mics for filmmaking.

That said, if you're just getting into streaming, starting with something you won't need to upgrade for a while is worthwhile. The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Sennheiser Profile USB Microphone Streaming Set</a> includes a fantastic mic and a workhorse boom arm, meaning you'll be set for quite a long time.</p><p>This is a USB microphone, which means it's simple to use. Sennheiser continues in this direction by placing every control you'll need frequent hands-on access to directly on the front of the mic. There's no need to worry about diving into an app to get your settings right when everything is available right in front of you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The boom arm that comes with the Profile Streaming Set is surprisingly high quality. It features a cable management channel on one side, helping keep the USB cable out of your way. While the boom arm doesn't feature adjustments to tighten sections of the boom arm, this is because the arm does an impressive job of holding steady until you manually adjust it.</p><p>The Sennheiser Profile features a frequency range of 20Hz to 20kHz and supports 24-bit/48kHz audio. This seems fairly standard, and it is, but this doesn't speak to just how good the audio is on the Profile. It uses subtle built-in DSP to make your voice sound its best, but never flat or overly processed.</p><p>The Sennheiser Profile mic is available <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">bundled with the boom arm</a>, but if you already have a boom arm you love, you can also buy a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">standalone version of the microphone</a>.

The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Rode PSA1</a> is far from the most expensive desk-mount boom arm you can buy, but it's solid enough that most people will be happy with their purchase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most boom arms, the base attaches to your desk, while the boom arm can swivel 360 degrees around. The arm features up to three feet of horizontal reach, meaning you can mount it near the back of your desk without worrying that it will reach a comfortable speaking position.</p><p>While many boom arms are meant to work with certain mics, this isn't the case with the PSA1.
