"It was the first time the three of us had worked together. I love the dynamic of new co-writing combinations ... you never know what will happen. I had worked with Chris on some pop projects but this was our first country song ... the first of many!"</p><p>"Chris started playing a great groove on the mandolin, and it called for an emotional lyric," Gorley continues. "We discussed a few concepts and settled on running into an ex, pretending not to still have feelings for them, wishing you didn't still care for them, but knowing you do."</p><p>"Out of all of the places in this little town / Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down / I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't too red / Since we been over, been trying like crazy to get you out of my head," they wrote in the opening lyrics to 'Why Ya Wanna.'</p><p>"The chorus melody and lyric came fast, and we just rolled with it," notes Gorley. "We thought it painted a great picture and had a great flow to it. At the end of the chorus, we stumbled upon the phrase, 'Why ya wanna/ Make me keep wanting you,' and it worked perfectly for the lyrical hook."</p><p>"So, why ya wanna / Show up in a old t-shirt that I love / Why ya gotta tell me that I'm looking good / Don't know what / You were thinkin' / You were doing / Moving in for a hug / Like you don't know I'm coming unglued / Why ya gotta / Why ya wanna / Make me keep wanting you," they wrote in the song's chorus.</p><p>"Once we had the idea going, the rest of the lyrics and melody came very fast," says Gorley of the 'Why Ya Wanna' lyrics. "Catt and I finished it up while Chris was working on a demo track, then I had to leave. A couple of hours later they sent me an amazing demo with Catt singing it great, and it sounded awesome. She really had emotion on the demo vocal."</p><p>"Soon after we wrote it, Catt said some people were wanting to hold the song for a new artist on Warner Bros., Jana Kramer," Gorley adds. "She told me to trust her ... that Jana was amazing and it was going to be a great project, so we never pitched it anywhere else. Thankfully a few months later Jana recorded the song and now it's her first single. I'm glad it's becoming a hit for her. I'm thankful we got the chance to write it. I suppose the three of us should write again!"</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Jana Kramer, 'Why Ya Wanna'</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5melnqsvsCmnKtlp53GbsXAZq6app6Weq3F0aKarGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjana-kramer-why-ya-wanna-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjana-kramer-why-ya-wanna-lyrics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjana-kramer-why-ya-wanna-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjana-kramer-why-ya-wanna-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjana-kramer-why-ya-wanna-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjana-kramer-why-ya-wanna-lyrics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./halle-bailey-end-little-mermaid-filming-sunset-tease-ariel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./halle-bailey-end-little-mermaid-filming-sunset-tease-ariel.html>Halle Bailey Celebrates End of Little Mermaid Filming with Beautiful Sunset Tease</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./python-convert-image-file-format.html>How to Convert Image File Format Using Python</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./python-convert-image-file-format.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
