The epaulets and boxy shoulder pads add more volume to the oversized fit while providing a contrasting look to the silhouette.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in both classic khaki and a thyme green shade, think of this as your go-to, everyday option to pair with everything from classic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>black work pants</a> and knitwear to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jeans</a> and T-shirts on the weekend.

The lightweight material is extremely easy to layer and feels substantial for the price point, while also being water-resistant. Hitting below the knee, this 3/4 length option is belted with a matching sash and comes in sizes up to 3X.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you choose the stone or black colorway, either hue can be mixed and matched with wardrobe essentials such as button-downs, trousers, jeans, and more.

Problematic days where the temperatures are chilly in the mornings and evenings but hot in the afternoon, are no match for this cotton and nylon-blended material that has a looser fit allowing it to be layered or worn alone.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This minimalist style hits at a medium length, right below the knee, and is a great basic to have on repeat in your wardrobe. The best part is that this trench comes in five colors, including black, gray, and brown, and a full size range from XXS to 5X. Pair with a turtleneck, trousers, and Chelsea boots when it’s colder, and then a T-shirt and mini skirt when warmer temperatures hit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, nylon<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–5X | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-short-sam-edelman-buckle-belt-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Short</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sam Edelman Buckle Belt Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Sam Edelman Buckle Belt Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-uvKQ1XAIHZ2VwL1BGv6N8khSX8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sam-edelman-buckle-belt-trench-coat-ff71751223ba41f8816d4fe23332b5fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The coat is fully lined.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no sizes above an XL.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking for a shorter option, both Barton and content creator <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Daniela Ramirez</a> recommend this Sam Edelman buckled trench. The single, button-front closure features oversized, contrasting buttons — a call-out detail for Barton. Belted cuffs and a matching sash belt round out the simple design elements. The silhouette is more tailored, so those who prefer an oversized fit should consider other options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although this coat comes in five different colorways, both experts suggest the blush pink colorway, as a welcome alternative to classic khaki. “The blush option is versatile while showing off a girly personal style that can transition perfectly from fall to spring,” Ramirez says. When it comes to styling, Barton suggests leaning into the spring hue and going for a monochrome look. “I would pair the pink one with a fun and bright spring dress, or a pink dress for a monotone look,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-london-fog-womens-single-breasted-long-trench-coat-with-epaulettes-and-belt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LONDON FOG Women's Single Breasted Long Trench Coat with Epaulettes and Belt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XySCbOquIqDZXyhRVrt8WEOlrGM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/london-fog-single-breasted-long-trench-coat-6642761144344100943e2043f2c33518.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The quality of the fabric is outstanding for the price.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Reviewers mention that the material may wrinkle easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our experts couldn’t get enough of styles from London Fog. Ramirez suggests this single-breasted option in black, for an alternative in color to a traditional khaki. “The black option is just as classic as the tan ones,” she says, and we couldn’t agree more. This cotton and polyester blend coat has a single-breasted cut with contrast horn buttons. Epaulettes, a sash belt, front welt pockets, and belted cuffs round out the traditional design features. The coat is fully lined and the fabric has also been tested to be water-resistant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The length of this coat is on the longer side at 49 inches, making it ideal for those with height. “If you are on the taller side, this one is perfect for you,” Ramirez says. Even if you’re not tall, this coat provides full coverage from any unwanted showers damaging your look or an unwarranted puddle splash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>S–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-mango-angela-belted-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mango Angela Belted Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Mango Angela Belted Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oZwY4pRU253C0nTpccNoXRFH1vc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mango-angela-belted-trench-coat-e75e08feeccb47e7ba4d022a5b10e5c0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The price point is affordable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It does not come in plus sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Sometimes you just want easy breezy,” Thorpe tells InStyle. “This traditional style can be worn with anything.” The cut is free of lots of bells and whistles and features a straightforward design consisting of epaulets, a storm flap, and a belted waistline. Ramirez also favors Mango as a great resource for trench coats, based on the brand’s great price point and quality. “For me, it is very important to shop smart and wear your pieces throughout the seasons and years,” she says. This timeless style can do just that.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, the unique, sage colorway is what drew Thorpe to this style. It can still be styled with practically everything but offers a refreshing alternative to a sand-colored khaki. She highlights the no-fuss washability, as well, since this is made from partial cotton fabrication, allowing for hand washing and air drying — no dry cleaning required.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-soft-reformation-kensington-trench></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Soft</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Kensington Trench</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kensington Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jhhW-_hlzDokDykKqwkv-oNlYIo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kensington-trench-4eb2849340514f6f9caf2dfacf0c7033.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The shape is classic and fluid.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The fabric is not treated to be water-resistant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This double-breasted trench is made from lightweight, 100 percent Tencel fabric and is absolutely stunning and classic,” Barton says. Tencel is an eco-friendly fiber that is derived from controlled or certified-sourced, natural, raw material wood. Since the result is lighter weight, the material is closer to a woven, suiting fabric, creating a more fluid silhouette, rather than being stiff and structured. Side pockets, a double-breasted front seamline, and a soft sash complete the minimal design attributes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The coat comes in two shades of beige — a traditional khaki and a softer, oyster colorway. The neutral colorways allow for this coat to be interchanged with your whole wardrobe. “I think this trench would look so lovely with a pair of wide-leg pants or trousers,” Barton recommends. “[It’s] perfect for the in-between spring weather.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Tencel lyocell | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-everlane-the-cotton-long-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Cotton Long Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Cotton Long Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dBXpvb8PUHg55ZNR06KS5pJQgPk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-cotton-long-trench-coat-47821ea604b64553b6e3ba172c6286d4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The coat is made from cotton.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Customers say it runs large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for something with a longer length? Whether you’re on the taller side or just prefer a longer hemline, Everlane’s long, cotton trench coat is a great pick. Designed with a timeless fit, the double-breasted shape has raglan sleeves that give off a slouchier, relaxed vibe. Classic epaulets, a vented back and storm flap, plus pockets, give this coat plenty of authentic, heritage detailing you’d want from a modern style.

The design is different from the other shapes on our list since it has an athletic nod — emphasized by the metal zip front and adjustable drawcord waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When packing for a trip of any length, versatility is key. “You can dress this up or down, which is practical while on vacation or work trips,” Thorpe notes. Since this coat is plain black, it can be a true power player. Layer over a sweater or sweatshirt and jeans on the weekend, your favorite workout set on the way to the gym, or stash in your laptop bag for any signs of inclement weather on the horizon (it’s waterproof!) during a long work commute.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-double-breasted-jcrew-double-breasted-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Double-Breasted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Double Breasted Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Double Breasted Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/58UN5p2djKc8qXMBDxhmNJnGp6Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jcrew-double-breasted-trench-coat-f2e6053c32aa4efdba71fa72013de9da.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be machine-washed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some petite reviewers mention the shoulder runs big.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There is nothing more traditional than a double-breasted trench coat, but J.Crew managed to find a way to modernize the classic silhouette, with a few updated design details. An exaggerated storm flap has both pointed tips in the front and back, adding a unique look to the overall shape. And for those that don’t know — a storm flap provides an extra layer of insulation to keep you extra dry. Since this coat is made from water-repellent, cotton canvas fabric, you actually will stay dry in the rain.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Standard features such as a removable tie waist and flap welt pockets further the menswear-inspired look.

It pairs perfectly with crisp, blue shirting and white denim, or a floral sundress and chunky boots for those cooler days full of spring showers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–24 | <strong>Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hooded-barbour-hebrides-waterproof-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hooded</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Barbour Hebrides Waterproof Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Barbour Hebrides Waterproof Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/s4Q_41bdcJDzSE6-X9iFHNM-nN4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/barbour-hebrides-waterproof-jacket-9191de960dfa4ae8a2085b480a0e7b06.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This trench has a waterproof coating and is washable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is only one colorway.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Barbour has been making quality, heritage outerwear since 1894, inspired by the English countryside where the company originated and remains to this day. Specializing in coated coats and jackets, you can rest knowing that each garment has been put to the test and truly will hold up in the elements. The Hebrides trench coat is a favorite of ours, thanks to this miraculous coating that withstands rain, wind, and snow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The single-breasted design boasts a zip front closure, making it easier to take on and off, with the buttons being mainly for decoration. Our favorite part is the removable hood, which when no hat or umbrella is available, is a true lifesaver. We also love the signature, plaid lining within, giving it an extra special detail. Dressed up or down, this is one that was made to last and won’t wear out after a season.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyamide<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>2–14;<strong> </strong>1X–3X | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-water-resistant-lauren-ralph-lauren-water-resistant-belted-single-breasted-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Water-Resistant</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lauren Ralph Lauren Water Resistant Belted Single Breasted Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lauren Ralph Lauren Water Resistant Belted Single Breasted Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ONOenp9X8M2rg9MK9Q0gOi6TQHo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lauren-ralph-lauren-water-resistant-belted-single-breasted-trench-coat-89d0a4080b354529b28ca11f57b1a625.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lauren Ralph Lauren</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This coat is available in two colors.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It is made only partially with cotton, not fully.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you prefer the buttoned-up nature of a single-breasted trench, this Lauren Ralph Lauren option has one expert’s stamp of approval. “Talk about a super sophisticated trench,” says Barton. “I love that this piece is water-resistant and comes with a fun, marble-accented belt and buttons.” Other notable features include a pointed collar, self-tie waist, and that it is lined for comfort and long-lasting quality. The fabric has more structure, and the silhouette hits right below the knees for ample coverage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to styling, the sky's the limit — it really is that versatile. “Since this one is single-breasted, I'd pair [it] with a statement sweater and simple pair of jeans and sneakers,” Barton suggests.

Made from a non-stretch, crisp gabardine fabric that is ultra-durable, as well as water-resistant. The slightly oversized look has a looser cut in the shoulder area and body, making layering all the easier. “This trench is both stylish and functional,” Thorpe says. “The signature, striped belt is a cute accent that fits a casual, laid-back vibe.” We agree, the bonus striped elements set this one apart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to styling, you can naturally go <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the Parisian way</a> and pair this trench with a striped tee or button-up shirt, jeans, and ballet flats.

The Randy trench has a perfectly oversized fit, giving off a cool, effortless feel that would feel right at home anywhere from a gritty, downtown New York street to a Parisian boulevard. The lightweight, twill fabric is water-resistant, too, so protection from the elements has not gone unnoticed.

A style that comes in leather (this one is vegan) is a wardrobe necessity, for those living in colder climates or faced with chillier days of spring and fall. “I’m obsessed with this trench strictly for its style factor,” Thorpe says. “It’s bold and very sophisticated.” The graphic, black and white color combination is unique and will be sure to make a statement wherever you wear it. “The unique contrast details are great and it’s vegan leather, which is a plus,” she adds. “This is a fashion-worthy investment piece.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep things monochrome when it comes to styling, by wearing this coat over a flowy, wide-leg pant and silky blouse, for a polished look <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>inspired by ’70s glamor</a>.

Today it’s an iconic fashion piece that has expanded far beyond uniform dressing. Investing in a Burberry trench means investing in the original. The quality is unmatched, featuring the best materials and draping. Crafted by specialist tailors who take years to master the stitch work on this garment, this worthy investment is produced with extreme care and detail in England.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Kensington comes in three length options including short, mid-length, and long, so you can find your perfect match. It’s made from water-resistant cotton gabardine, and lined in, of course, the brand’s signature plaid fabric that dates back to the 1920s, for unparalleled fashion appeal. A throat latch and hook-and-eye collar closure ensure your neckline is also protected for warmth, and are just a few of the tiny details that make this garment so special.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–16 | <strong>Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-sam-edelman-contrast-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sam Edelman Contrast Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Sam Edelman Contrast Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/T_p48mQKxrW95Ee_NvfaXGvV8bo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sam-edelman-contrast-trench-coat-06096304b1494e3cbe9adb51e5c2d6e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The belt is long, allowing many styling possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>According to reviewers, petites might need to shorten the sleeves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the climate you live in and the time of year, sometimes all you need is a light jacket. Sam Edelman’s contrast trench is the ideal option for a light layer throughout the year. Featuring a few tweaks that make it stand out, Barton is a fan of this coat. “This trench has a super fun twist to the classic, with corduroy peeking out of the lapels and belt,” says Barton. “I love that this trench comes in khaki, white, and navy, if you're looking for some variety,”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the design is so classic, it’s very easy to style accordingly. “This cotton-blend trench would look so cute with a pair of trousers, a simple blouse, and your favorite sneaker,” Barton suggests.

Layer yours over a Canadian tuxedo-inspired denim jacket and jeans for a cool, undone look, or pair it with a floral dress for the ultimate vernal vibes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–16 | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fashion-forward-sandro-paris-pleated-trench-coat-with-belt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fashion-Forward</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sandro Paris Pleated Trench Coat With Belt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sandro Paris Pleated Trench Coat With Belt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DRkjzWfiqlphpouunvdB6_WMC2U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sandro-paris-pleated-trench-coat-with-belt-e8037b30bda8468d853d484f3d3503c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sandro Paris</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The fabric is made partially with recycled materials.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pleating might wrinkle easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sandro often experiments with fashionable twists to classic garments. Its spin on the traditional trench coat features beautiful, accordion pleating covering the majority of the garment, giving it a uniquely voluminous body and some fashion-forward edge. The rounded storm flaps offer another striking design detail that is also useful in warding off the elements and the fabric for this coat is made with partially recycled polyester and organic resin buttons, so there is an element of sustainability to this garment, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This one can be truly dressed up since it has a fancier feel, so your favorite dresses, skirts, and other less casual items have a solid match for work, events, and important meetings. However, don’t let that stop you from wearing it casually, either. It transitions to the weekend seamlessly when worn with a simple top and jeans or even a workout set on your way to your next gym class.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-polo-ralph-lauren-double-breasted-twill-trench-coat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Polo Ralph Lauren Double-Breasted Twill Trench Coat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Polo Ralph Lauren Double-Breasted Twill Trench Coat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kgduYd0IJmQc9Bw-wn-q89txleM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/polo-ralph-lauren-double-breasted-twill-trench-coat-30d77acbd7e3414bbc60d36e23fd4f6a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sturdy, cotton twill fabrication.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It does not come in extended sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You would be hard-pressed to find a more classic option than this double-breasted trench from Polo Ralph Lauren. The high-quality, cotton twill fabric is lightweight yet sturdy. The epaulets, storm flaps, and sleeve cuffs are all trimmed with horn-effect buttons, featuring a subtle logo engraved into the design. The waist belt has a buckle closure, rather than being a free-flowing sash, adding another military-inspired finish that adds polish to the overall design and cinches the waistline.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the idea of this trench styled true to the heritage, Ralph Lauren look.

Barton also suggests taking into consideration the material. “When shopping for trench coats, I'm always on the lookout for water-resistant material,” Barton says. “Especially during the spring, when the weather is constantly fluctuating. I love relying on a waterproof trench to keep me chic and dry.” Alternatively, if you live in a warmer climate, Ramirez recommends this as your go-to for winter. “I also take into consideration the fabric because I live in a warmer state and I want to use it for those amazing Miami winter days,” she says. “This means avoiding heavy linings and looking more for cotton linings for breathability.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fit: </strong>“Because I am petite, I pay a lot of attention to the length and fit,” Ramirez says. “You should wear the trench coat, the coat should not be wearing you.” Her personal preference is a hemline that hits mid-calf. “I also go for a bit of an oversized fit to take into consideration sweaters and layers,” she notes. Barton also recommends looking for something of the same length. “I love snagging a super classic, mid-calf length trench,” she says. “It looks so cute with a maxi or midi dress, or your favorite pair of denim.” Ultimately, be sure to leave room for a little trial and error while shopping, to find a trench coat that looks best on your body type.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Design: </strong>When it comes to selection, unanimously our experts recommend a classic approach. “You really can't go wrong with a khaki double-breasted trench,” Barton says. If you don’t have a trench already in your closet, invest in something traditional first. “It is such a classic piece that can last decades in your wardrobe, that I would stay away from any details that make it trendy,” Ramirez says. “For example, I would avoid any denim trench coats, a two-tone one, or maybe one with extremely oversized sleeves.” For Thorpe, the garment’s hue is a defining feature. “I consider trench coats a timeless garment, so color is important,” she says. “I would go for a solid color, rather than a print for versatility.”<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best color for a trench coat?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, our experts encourage a classic khaki. “This color fits wonderfully with anything in your spring wardrobe,” Barton says. “However the occasional pop of color, like a blush pink, is always fun.” Ramirez also prefers something in camel tone, but encourages readers to “take your skin color and undertones into consideration.” As for Thorpe, a play on khaki is her pick. “Khaki is the more traditional color however, I am into army green because it is unexpected,” she says.​<strong><br></strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you care for a trench coat?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Always start by checking the care label inside, as it will depend on the fabric, the lining, and if it's safe to machine wash,” Ramirez encourages. “It's always best to spot clean when needed and to wash it 2–3 times per season.” Barton also stresses the importance of following the brand’s guidelines for washing. “Depending on the trench style, I would machine wash on cold, or dry clean,” she says. “I always handle it with extra care so that my piece lasts as long as possible.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thorpe’s top tips include reading the care labels; however, she notes that dry cleaning is always a top choice. “Store it in a closet avoiding any sunlight that might alter the color,” she adds. “If you tend to wear your trench out in rainy weather and not just for style, have it treated with water repellent and also air it out after each use to avoid mold and mildew.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop with Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Full-time freelance writer and fashion editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kristina Rutkowski</a> has been covering all things style, trend, and shopping for over 10 years.
