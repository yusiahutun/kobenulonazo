There was no way they were going to give a teenager that job. But they interviewed me for it and liked me enough to offer me a full-time job as a personal banker.</p><p>“From there, I worked my way up and ended up in corporate banking at the age of 21.”</p><p>While it was her dream job, Lucy said the bank targets were “insane” and she was being put under a lot of pressure.</p><p>She continued: “We were forced to give money to clients we knew couldn't repay it. I was told to ring and offer people home loans, put them through the process of a mortgage application and then decline it just so my manager could hit their home loan application target.</p><p>“I stood up to my manager once and she threatened my job. I quit the next day. I loved that job but not enough to ethically live with putting people into financial distress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29483741.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_BagBANNER.jpg><p>“I was separating from my husband around this time, so was in a bit of a life transformation stage.”</p><p>Lucy was looking for a way that she could leave the job behind but still be able to provide for her two children.</p><p>At the time, she had a friend who was doing OnlyFans so she messaged her asking for more information.</p><p>Lucy didn't understand what OnlyFans was but she knew she was a newly single mum and now unemployed.</p><p>“I had two beautiful little boys who needed me. So, I thought 'Stuff it, I'm signing up to OnlyFans'. I was really shy initially; I was way in over my head,” she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>“I got married at 22, I had never even been to a strip club and I had no idea how to take sexy photos or how to talk sexually. But I quickly found my feet and started finding myself falling in love with the industry.</p><p>“That was almost four years ago and I love it more than ever now. I've travelled interstate to do collaborations and attend Sexpo, I've been nominated for awards, I've bought property and set myself and my kids up for life.</p><p>“I can do school pick up and drop off every single day and we rely on no one I'm a mother, first and foremost. But a part of being a mother is ensuring your kids are provided for, and I can do that all on my own.”</p><p>Lucy told us that this career change was a “huge transformation” in a variety of different ways.</p><p>Not only was she able to support her family by herself but she also became a much happier version of herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29570003.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Image.jpg><p>“I have never been happier, everyone who knows me says that I am glowing and confident. I look back to who I was three years ago and I don't know that girl,” she said.</p><p>“I'm now raising my gorgeous kids solo, we have enough money to live an amazing lifestyle and I absolutely love my job.”</p><p>Lucy is thriving so much on OnlyFans that she’s been approached by porn studios in hopes she’d work for them.</p><p>The 32-year-old has made the decision to only stick to OnlyFans as she doesn’t like to travel and wants to stay home and be close to her kids.</p><p>She added: “I could go to America and pursue a studio porn career; I've got friends that have done it. But for me, I like working from my bedroom around school hours.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29570014.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Image.jpg><p>Now Lucy is making four times the amount she ever was when working in banking – even though she was already on a six-figure salary back then.</p><p>The brunette beauty loves that her job now allows her to work from home and no longer has the stresses she used to have.</p><p>“I absolutely love [my job]. I am so much more confident, I'm my own boss and I work my own hours,” Lucy said.</p><p>“I am so grateful that I can be there for all my kids' sporting events, school events and I have been able to nurture them through the separation between their dad and me.”</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><span><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'I'm a mum with a sexy job – my son supports me even though it makes him cringe'</a></b></span></li><li><span><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'Men pay me to humiliate them – I love saying they'll never get a woman in real life'</a></b></span></li><li><span><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'I quit porn because of jealous boyfriend – now I'm back and better than ever'</a></b></span></li><li><b><i>For more lifestyle stories, <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>sign up to the free Hot Topics newsletter here.</a></i></b></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGilpaJ6pbXVqKmcnaNitba%2FwZqlnWWhqra1v4ybmKejmaO0bn6Ybm1ycGZs</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmum-divorces-husband-quits-banking-29569867.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmum-divorces-husband-quits-banking-29569867.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmum-divorces-husband-quits-banking-29569867.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmum-divorces-husband-quits-banking-29569867.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmum-divorces-husband-quits-banking-29569867.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmum-divorces-husband-quits-banking-29569867.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./6613cb2522601d53588b4595-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./6613cb2522601d53588b4595-html.html>NFL: La NFL, patas arriba: un bombazo, un 'sper equipo' y una estrella del rugby para Mahomes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./georgia-country-singers-cole-swindell-luke-bryan-jason-aldean-kip-moore.html>Georgia's Hottest Country Singers, One Epic Photo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./georgia-country-singers-cole-swindell-luke-bryan-jason-aldean-kip-moore.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
