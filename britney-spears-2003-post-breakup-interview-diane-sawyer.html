Spears continued. "When did I have a shopping problem?"</p><p>Here, Spears opened up about her mental health state in the months following her 2002 breakup with Justin Timberlake. "Something I never shared when I had that big breakup years ago was that I couldn’t talk afterwards… I never spoke to anyone for a very long time… I was in shock."</p><p>As such, she feels it was "pretty lame of my dad and three men to show up at my door when I could hardly speak… two days later they put Diane Sawyer in my living room…they forced me to talk!!!" In a statement to People, Jamie Spears denied any involvement.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1d3d2819-3cda-4a79-a60b-656691899784 data-container-ref=toofab:article:854152d0-1fb6-4bb4-90da-8123f0163d3a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/5by4/2021/11/09/dc85808cffa14082897fa42b72020a75_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jamie Lynn Spears Details 'Terrible' Tension With Her Father During Her Teen Pregnancy</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Jamie never set up any interview with Diane Sawyer and was not present for any such interview," he said in a statement via his lawyer. "He had nothing to do with Britney's career at this point and was completely uninvolved in this interview." Britney's conservatorship, which saw Jamie firmly in control of her career, began in 2008.</p><p>"I was a baby… I was almost 22 and didn’t understand… but I f------ know now" Spears continued in her post. "She said ‘a woman or a girl…’ I would like to say now, ‘Ma’am, I’m a Catholic slut!!! You wanna join me at a mass and I can serve your husband my certificate on shopping for anonymous players???’ I should spend a thousand dollars if I want every day of my life and she can kiss my white a--."</p><p>In the lengthy post, Britney also lashed out at her family, saying she was proud, and maybe a little embarrassed, to be excited about taking $300 from an ATM of her own money. "I'm not embarrassed to share this ... well maybe a little ... but I'm more embarrassed for my family for condoning the fact that I wasn't allowed to have cash for so long when I worked my little a-- off for them."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3fc16b0a-662c-49c2-a25e-08e6a64235f1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:854152d0-1fb6-4bb4-90da-8123f0163d3a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/de/5by4/2021/11/12/de3cadbda85147558243944a2ae52a23_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Britney Spears Reacts to End of Her Conservatorship: "I Think I’m Gonna Cry the Rest of the Day"</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I'm embarrassed for the state of California for permitting my father to have me work as hard as he worked me all those years and never seeing a dime," she continued. "I'm embarrassed for all of them and I'm sad for them because I know my value and worth now ... and they LOST ME !!!"</p><p>Spears also indicated that she didn't think she would ever again tour at the pace she was during the heyday of her career, explaining that she "hated it."</p><p>"I know I'm not playing in huge arenas with my loud band anymore but I will be honest and say life on the road is hard!!" she wrote. "My first three years in the biz and on the road were great but I'll be completely honest and say that after those three tours and the pace I was going... I don't think I ever want to do it again."</p><p>It's unclear why Britney removed the post. Renewed criticism of Sawyer's interview began in the wake of the "Framing Britney Spears" documentary. It led to a public apology from Justin Timberlake to both Spears and Janet Jackson (the latter for his role in the aftermath of their infamous Super Bowl "wardrobe malfunction"). Sawyer has yet to comment.</p><a id=gallery-link-bab2ed15-18b4-4cd2-88e4-7d2f1ab4fe20 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bab2ed15-18b4-4cd2-88e4-7d2f1ab4fe20 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:854152d0-1fb6-4bb4-90da-8123f0163d3a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b8/4by3/2021/10/01/b884b6338f0d400d92ef4c0dcf4fa40a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGtmamxfl7%2BqwM2esGaroJqus7%2BMa2dpa12lvLTAjJupnpmbqr1utc2tnKuumZrEbrDImqWeZaOWxLqx0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-2003-post-breakup-interview-diane-sawyer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbritney-spears-2003-post-breakup-interview-diane-sawyer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-2003-post-breakup-interview-diane-sawyer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbritney-spears-2003-post-breakup-interview-diane-sawyer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-2003-post-breakup-interview-diane-sawyer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-2003-post-breakup-interview-diane-sawyer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-steen-wiki-married-husband-or-boyfriend-and-net-worth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-steen-wiki-married-husband-or-boyfriend-and-net-worth-html.html>Jessica Steen Wiki, Married, Husband or Boyfriend and Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./reese-witherspoon-selling-los-angeles-family-home.html>Reese Witherspoon lists beautiful $25million home after just 2 years</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./reese-witherspoon-selling-los-angeles-family-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
