The signs may not be evident at first, but with time you will learn about her and how she behaves around you. Here are the top 20 sure signs that she is pretending to love:</p><h3>1. She is distant</h3><p class=align-left>How do you tell if a girl is faking a relationship? She is barely present when you need her company. The girl will avoid you whether you are on speaking terms or bad terms. She will not check up on you, and when you try to talk to her, she will respond just to be nice to you.</p><p class=align-left>She can go a week without talking to you if you do not reach out first. This kind of behaviour should be your first red flag, as someone distant most likely has zero interest in you or what you have to offer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/605bf9e76638d2a3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make a girl think about you without talking: 15 ways</span></p></a><h3>2. She dismisses talks about the future</h3><p class=align-left>You will try to bring up talks about your future together, your dreams, your plans, and even <a href=#>family</a> life, but she will be least interested. This is because she does not see a future with you.</p><p class=align-left>As a man, you are only there to fulfil her current desires, whatever they may be, but not plan a life in the future. If you notice that conversations about the future are only coming from you, then you already have your answer about the state of your relationship.</p><h3>3. You never know what is really going on with her</h3><p class=align-left>How do you tell if a girl is just keeping you around? You can never tell if she is having a difficult time at work or in a terrible mood. You cannot read what is going on in her head because everything about her is vague.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 tell-tale signs she has moved on to someone else already</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Is she nervous? Does she want to be left alone? Does she crave your companionship? Is she having family issues? You just never know. She is the girl you can understand without actually knowing her.</p><h3>4. Suggests a break up after every fight</h3><p class=align-left>Quarrels, fights, and arguments are inevitable in every relationship. Subtle arguments are, in fact, a <a href=#>good sign in a relationship </a>as it shows that both parties are free to express themselves and learn from each other. However, too many arguments every other day should be a concern.</p><p class=align-left>If you happen to be in a relationship where your girl is constantly throwing the break-up word after every minor argument, then know that she wants out of the relationship and is looking for a tiny excuse to be on her way.</p><h3>5. She never texts first</h3><p class=align-left>There are no rules to texting when in a relationship. Anyone can text first. Do you feel like talking? A simple "Hey, love" will do you good. Take a moment and think about the number of times you have texted first and compare it to the number of times she hits you up first.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c703037053dfd81a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 sure signs she wants a serious relationship with you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Has she only texted once, or never texted at all? You have your answer. She says she loves you but doesn’t show it because she does not feel you the same way you feel her. A girl in love will send <a href=#>multiple texts </a>to you, whether during the day or nighttime.</p><h3>6. Her ex features in her conversations one too many times</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9e65b2615ba73883.jpg><p class=align-left>The past should remain in the past. No one wants to hear about their lover's ex, especially when they are conversing. A lady that keeps mentioning her ex is one to stay away from. She is most likely keeping you around because the ex wants nothing to do with her.</p><p class=align-left>She is still hung up on him and will run back to his arms if a chance presents itself. It is one of the major signs a girl is using you for attention. She compares you to her ex because she probably misses him or just compares him to you to mess with your ego.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>7. She has never offered to pay for anything</h3><p class=align-left>It is the norm for men to pay when a couple is going out or getting something for themselves. However, a girl in love will never hesitate to chip in every once in a while. You cannot be the only one who pays for dates, especially if she is the one who came up with the idea of a date.</p><p class=align-left>She has never paid for a take-out, bought you your favourite smoothie, or even forgot to get you something nice for your birthday. She simply does not care about you.</p><h3>8. She owns a bag full of excuses</h3><p class=align-left>She is always full of excuses. You will ask her why she has not done something you had asked her to, and she will bring up a long list of excuses. You want to hang out with her at her place, and she will, out of the blue, remember that she has errands to run.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She never does anything for you voluntarily. If she does, she will follow up with complaints to infuriate you. So keep off, such girls.</p><h3>9. She talks down to you</h3><p class=align-left>Respect is needed for any <a href=# title>relationship to survive</a>. Just as love is a staple, respect is also crucial. A woman who talks down on you, scolds you like a child, and even raises her voice against you is showing you signs she doesn’t respect you.</p><p class=align-left>If she does not respect you as her man, she, without a doubt, secretly resents you. She makes you feel small in everything. You have no voice around her, and you worship the ground she walks on. You should not be in a relationship with such a woman as she will soon ruin your self-esteem.</p><h3>10. She is flirty with other guys</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the major red flags in anyone. A person who is flirty with everyone does not have any romantic feelings towards you. You will confront her about it, but she will continue with the habit because she wants you to get livid and leave her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She is pretending to love you if she does this, as any woman in love does not flirt with other men. She reserves her love and naughty side to her man. Leave the relationship as soon as you discover that she is flirtatious with other men.</p><h3>11. You have never met her friends or family</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/605bf9e76638d2a3.jpg><p class=align-left>Do you know any of her friends? What about her family? No one in her circle knows of you. You have probably shown her to your friends and even made her meet your brother or sister, but you don't know anything about her.</p><p class=align-left>The red flag is a major sign that she is not serious about the relationship. If you mattered to her, she could have invited you to meet her friends, taken you to her favourite hanging out spots, and maybe had you chat with her mom on the phone.</p><h3>12. She wants to keep it on the down low</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She will convince you that she loves you but does not love out loud for various reasons. She wants to keep your relationship on the low, not because she is a private person, but because she is pretending to love you.</p><p class=align-left>She hates it when you ask her to make it official, as you are ruining her plans. In her life, you are hidden like something illegal. Have some dignity and exit the relationship.</p><h3>13. She is critical of you</h3><p class=align-left>She says she loves you, but her actions say otherwise. You will make one wrong move or make a mistake, which is the only thing she will discuss. She is extremely critical of you, more critical than she is of other people.</p><p class=align-left>You cannot breathe around her because you are scared of making mistakes. She will lament about a mistake you made weeks ago and remind you every moment of how much of a mess you made. Being in the same environment with that individual is not good for your mental health.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs700m7k0sp76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get a girl to like you</span></p></a><h3>14. She rarely compliments you</h3><p class=align-left>Women love receiving compliments and will reciprocate if they love what they see. When was the last time your girlfriend told you that you looked good? You went out of your way to change your wardrobe but did not receive a single compliment from her.</p><p class=align-left>Why? She does not love you the way you imagine she does. She almost certainly just tolerates you because she is still looking for the ideal man for herself.</p><h3>15. Too secretive</h3><p class=align-left>A secretive person is one to stay away from. Why too many secrets if you are leading a straight life? She has loads of secrets from her past that affect your relationship's well-being. She does not open up on anything but deals with issues in the dark.</p><p class=align-left>This is one of the biggest signs that she is not in love with you. Being with a girl with too many secrets may get you in trouble, so you better watch out if your girlfriend is of this kind.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3m7e6t7ss3jg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Romantic sweet words for her</span></p></a><h3>16. Everything is on her terms</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b420bfb3872f93cb.jpeg><p class=align-left>The movie you are to watch in the evening, the <a href=#>location for your date</a>, the meal you are to eat, and practically anything that concerns the both of you are on her terms. You let her have it her way only because you love her.</p><p class=align-left>She does not care that you want a change of scenery or have different plans for the day, she will demand what pleases her, and you will, unfortunately, give her. You need to love yourself a little more and not let people have too much control over your life.</p><h3>17. She is unpredictable</h3><p class=align-left>An unpredictable person is such a buzz kill. She will get you in high spirits but will kill the mood. With her, you can get hot and cold vibes at any time. Yet, she can be happy in the morning and will be a different person when the sun sets.</p><p class=align-left>What could be the reason for her mood swings? You will never know because she is erratic, never confides in you, and barely lets you in her <a href=#>world</a>.</p><h3>18. She will holla only if she needs something</h3><p class=align-left>She never calls first unless she needs something. She will only remember your number when she needs a favour from you. It does not matter how big or small the favour is; she merely runs to you when she is in need.</p><p class=align-left>Like the good boyfriend you are, you will sort out her needs, and that will be her last call to you until she needs something else. One thing you should take from this kind of partner is that you are being used.</p><h3>19. You do not exist on her socials</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone uses their social media differently. Some users make their social media pages their diaries, while others share little. This may not be a real sign.</p><p class=align-left>If you knew how she moved on social media before you were an item, things might be more precise. If she always talks about her previous lovers but does not mention anything about your relationship online, then there is a need to worry.</p><h3>20. You are just her fallback plan</h3><p class=align-left>You asked her out, and she probably said yes out of boredom or because she could not get the guy she was targeting. Your little meet-ups turned into a full-blown relationship, but she is jaded again and only uses you as she waits for her perfect man.</p><p class=align-left>She loves your company but only when she is lonely or bored. You are the last thing on her priority list, and she only has time for you when she does not have anything meaningful to do.</p><p class=align-left>Relationships sometimes need a little work and intelligence to prosper. Both parties need to be in love and not have a wandering eye. If your lover is the one who pays zero attention to you, then you should be wary of the signs she is pretending to love you. If you notice any sign, try to communicate with her, and if there is no change from her end, then it is time to call off the relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about the signs <a href=#>your soulmate is thinking of you</a>. Some people believe in soulmates, while others don’t. Those who do feel ecstatic knowing that the universe has preserved someone out there just for them.</p><p class=align-left>People who believe in soulmates often look for signs they are thinking of you. Luckily, the universe has a way of rewarding deserving people. However, even as you look out, always extend yourself some grace and appreciation for all the little things in life.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnl6q2pbHSaGtyamRmhm5%2Bj2aqop%2BeqHqxvsStnKecmaO0brjOr5xmoaOjwW6%2FxKugqK2jZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f492419-20-signs-pretending-love-isnt-serious.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f492419-20-signs-pretending-love-isnt-serious.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f492419-20-signs-pretending-love-isnt-serious.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f492419-20-signs-pretending-love-isnt-serious.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f492419-20-signs-pretending-love-isnt-serious.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f492419-20-signs-pretending-love-isnt-serious.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chinese-military-snubbed-invite-defence-conference-says-senior-us-admiral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chinese-military-snubbed-invite-defence-conference-says-senior-us-admiral.html>Chinese military snubbed invite to defence conference, says senior US admiral</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wanda-lynn-canady.html>Who is Wanda Lynn Canady dating?
