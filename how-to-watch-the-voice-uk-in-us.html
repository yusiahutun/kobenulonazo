Episodes air Saturday nights at 8:25 p.m. GMT (3:25 ET and 12:25 PT) on ITV and ITVX.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-the-host-of-the-voice-uk><strong>Who is the host of </strong><strong>The Voice UK</strong><strong>?</strong></h2><p>The host for The Voice UK is British television presenter and former model, Emma Willis. She took on hosting duties for The Voice UK in 2014 and has since become closely associated with the series. In addition to The Voice UK, Willis has hosted other British reality shows, including Big Brother UK and its celebrity counterpart, Celebrity Big Brother, making her a familiar face to UK audiences.</p><p>In an interview for ITV ahead of the show’s 11th season, Willis opened up about how much it means to her to return to the series year after year. “I’m just so chuffed that it’s still going! I’ve obviously done nine out of the eleven series as I didn’t do the first two but even that is essentially a decade of doing it,” she shared at the time. “When you’ve been doing something for that long, it’s always lovely to go back because it’s everyone you know, and it feels like it’s your holiday time with your mates. It’s not really work because it’s so much fun.”</p><p>Reflecting on what keeps fans coming back to the show, Willis gave credit to the “pure talent” highlighted on the series. “No matter what happens after the show finishes, you are guaranteed every week to see a member of the public with phenomenal talent,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Willis adds, “People who you probably can encounter in everyday life, such as nurses, healthcare assistants, lorry drivers – they are the Great British public just coming in and blowing our socks off with these voices that you would never know they had. I’d also say our coaches too because they love it so much and I think you can see that, it’s all just really genuine.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-are-the-voice-uk-coaches><strong>Who are </strong><strong>The Voice UK </strong><strong>coaches?</strong></h2><p>The coaches for The Voice UK season 12 are Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am, singer Olly Murs, music legend Sir Tom Jones and singer-songwriter Anne-Marie. Each of the coaches previously appeared on past seasons of The Voice UK, however, season 12 will mark the last time audiences see Olly Murs and Anne-Marie in their chairs, as they are both due to depart the series ahead of its return in 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-are-the-voice-uk-contestants><strong>Who are </strong><strong>The Voice UK</strong><strong> contestants?</strong></h2><p>Season 12 of The Voice UK is shaking things up. This year, the show will also feature musical groups alongside individual singers. Check back for the full list of The Voice UK contestants as the new season unfolds.</p><p>Speaking about this season’s new twist, host Emma Willis told ITV, “It’s always nice to add something you’ve never done before. There are loads of groups out there who’ve never had the chance to come and audition and now they can. We’ve had some great groups but for me there was an absolute corker of a group, they had the whole package—it was like watching Little Mix.”</p><p>The Voice UK is available to stream on ITV1’s website with a VPN in the United States.
