Paramedics took the child to Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p><p class=align-left>According to Elis Ortiz, he was at home with seven children that day; three were his, three were his girlfriend's (including Mejias), and one was his niece. Ortiz claimed when he woke up, he found Giovanni Mejias on the kitchen floor, not breathing with serious stomach bloating. He ordered one of the other children to call 911 as he performed CPR on Mejias.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28800e0e4f420ff5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi: Married Woman Faces Charges after Boyfriend Dies During Intimacy</span></p></a><h2 id=528053-giovanni-mejias-autopsy class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Giovanni Mejias autopsy</h2><p class=align-left>The medical examiner, Dr. David, later ruled Giovanni Mejias's death a murder from fatal abdomen injuries, adding that he had several older injuries like fractured ribs and bruising. He described Mejias' injuries as "remarkable" based on the location and number of injuries.</p><p class=align-left>Dr. David stated the injuries, which were at different healing levels, were a sign of abuse by an adult, and this led him to conclude the child's death was <a href=#>murder</a>.</p><h2 id=528053-who-is-elis-ortiz class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who is Elis Ortiz?</h2><p class=align-left>Elis Ortiz is Giovanni Mejias' father, although not his birth father. The couple began dating in December 2016 and moved in together in February 2017. They lived with seven children; three of the kids were Ortiz's, three were Hernandez's, and one was Ortiz's niece.</p><h2 id=528053-what-did-giovanni-mejias39-mother-say-about-elis-ortiz-in-court class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What did Giovanni Mejias' mother say about Elis Ortiz in court?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28800e0e4f420ff5.png><p class=align-left>Giovanni Mejias' mother, Hernandez, strongly defended her <a href=#>boyfriend</a>, Elis Ortiz. In her testimony during a preliminary Grand Rapids District Court hearing, Hernandez claimed that Ortiz had a good heart and loved children.

However, the children testified on trial that both Eliz Ortiz and their mother would kick, beat, and whip them. Given the evidence of her involvement in her children's abuse, it's no surprise she aligned herself with Eliz Ortiz.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sonja Hernandez</a>, Giovanni Mejias' mother, faced legal repercussions as she was subsequently sentenced for both second-degree child abuse and perjury during the trial concerning Giovanni's murder.

The Kent County Circuit Court judge Mark Trusock called Ortiz a monster and evil. He further said that what Ortiz did was disgusting and sickening and that he should never be allowed out of prison.</p><p class=align-left>At one point, Ortiz had to be forcefully removed from the court after becoming upset when the judge described Giovanni Mejias's injuries. Ortiz told the courtroom that there was no way he was going to sit there and let the judge say bad things before struggling with deputies. He was returned to the courtroom after about 10 minutes.</p><h2 id=528053-giovanni-mejias-netflix-documentary class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Giovanni Mejias Netflix documentary</h2><p class=align-left>There are speculations that a <a href=#>Netflix</a> <a href=#>crime documentary</a> about Giovanni Mejias's story is being worked on.
