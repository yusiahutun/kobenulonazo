There are practically endless applications of the language of the sky, and one of them is getting a read on how you'll feel and fare when you're in a particular location on the globe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yep, astrology, or more specifically, astrocartography, can allow you to gauge how your energy could shift depending on where you travel or relocate. You could pinpoint where you might feel at your most creative or where you could be challenged to do deeper self-work. Ahead, more about astrocartography and how to use it to plan your travel or next move.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Astrocartography</h3><p>Astrocartography, or locational astrology, is a system that was pioneered in the 1970s by astrologer Jim Lewis. It involves comparing your astrological birth chart to a map of the globe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-birth-chart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Birth Chart</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As long as you know the precise time and location you came into the world, you can create an accurate snapshot of the sky at the time of your birth. From that info, you can cast — generally via software these days, but it can also be done by hand — what's referred to as a natal, or birth, chart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your birth chart will not only show what signs the planets and luminaries (the sun and the moon) were in when you were born but also other information that offers even more insight into your astrological wiring, like houses, degrees, and the relationships between the planets and luminaries. (There are several free sites like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>cafeastrology.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>astrology.com</a>, where you can plug in your info and receive your birth chart in seconds.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you have your birth chart, you're ready to dip your toe into astrocartography, which involves taking your natal info and comparing it to the location of the sun, moon, and planets relative to the Earth when you were born.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-read-an-astrocartography-map></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Read an Astrocartography Map</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before computers were household items, astrologers would draw charts and astrocartography maps by hand. Now, in order to get your very own unique astrocartography map — which is a combination of your natal chart details and a world map — you can just head to a site like astro.com, which offers an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>AstroClick Travel feature</a>, or see a professional astrologer who specializes in astrocartography.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you look at your astrocartography map, you'll see it looks like a series of lines that run vertically up and down over continents and oceans. With the AstroClick Travel feature, they're color-coded, and you can actually click on them to get detailed info on what they mean. Each line corresponds to a planet and its position in the sky when you were born, and each planetary line offers its own unique energy that you'd experience when you're near that line geographically.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Planetary Lines</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sun:&nbsp;</strong>Visiting or living near this line will lead to greater confidence, a brighter mood, and a sense that you're comfier than usual in your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Moon:&nbsp;</strong>Because the moon is all about emotions, you could feel especially sensitive when you're near this line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Mercury:&nbsp;</strong>Being near the line of the messenger planet could boost your ability to think and communicate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Venus:&nbsp;</strong>Being near the line of the planet of love, beauty, and money can make you extra attractive, charming, and a bit of a magnet for romantic and creative pursuits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Mars:&nbsp;</strong>Because Mars rules action, energy, and sex, being near its line can make you braver, bolder, and perhaps a bit more argumentative.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Jupiter:&nbsp;</strong>Living or visiting the line associated with the magnifying, fortune-boosting planet can bring more luck and abundance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Saturn:&nbsp;</strong>The taskmaster planet is all about putting your nose to the grindstone, setting boundaries, accepting limitations, and committing fully — basically, being a grown-up. (Hello,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Saturn Return</a>.) For that reason, living or visiting near this line could promote maturity but feel like a bit of a downer at times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Uranus:</strong>&nbsp;Being near the line of the rebellious planet, which brings sudden change, can inspire you to strike out against convention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Neptune:&nbsp;</strong>Being near the line of this dreamy, rational, thought-hazing planet could bolster your imagination but also make you more susceptible to illusion and escapism.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pluto:&nbsp;</strong>Proximity to the line associated with the planet of transformation, power, death, and rebirth could require you to burn it all down and start again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Chiron:&nbsp;</strong>Being near the line of this comet, referred to as the "Wounded Healer" in astrology, can help you care for others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>North and south nodes (lunar nodes):&nbsp;</strong>The lines associated with these mathematical points (versus actual celestial bodies) speak to your destiny (north node) and karmic past (south node).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Four Angles or Cardinal Points</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, there are four angles or cardinal points — just like in your natal chart — to pay attention to when you're working with astrocartography. You'll notice on your astrocartography map that there are four Jupiter lines, four sun lines, four moon lines, et al. Basically, each planet pairs with each of these angles to offer multi-layered intel. The angles are:</p><li><strong>Rising or Ascendant (AC):&nbsp;</strong>Just like your&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rising or ascendant</a>&nbsp;in your natal chart, your rising or ascendant here represents the mask you wear out in the world.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>An example of how this might manifest in your astrocartography chart: If you travel or move to your moon AC line, you might be extra emotional, sensitive, or nurturing in a public-facing way, inspired to volunteer or become a nurse or caregiver.</li><li><strong>The Descendant (DC):</strong>&nbsp;The descendant line is associated with the seventh house of partnership, so it reflects one-on-one relationships. Find your Venus descendant line to get a sense of where you might meet your soul mate.</li><li><strong>The Imuni Coeli (IC):</strong>&nbsp;The IC line, also known as the cusp of the fourth house of home life, speaks to your family and roots. You'll be more meditative and internally focused when you're near your IC lines.</li><li><strong>The Medi-Coeli/Midheaven (MC):</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>MC line</a>, or cusp of the 10th house of career, has to do with public image and success. So, if you're hanging out near your Jupiter MC line, you can pretty much guarantee you'll enjoy some major luck related to your professional path.</li><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-astrocartography-for-travel-or-relocation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Astrocartography for Travel or Relocation</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For some people, it could feel daunting to find out that the town where you just bought a house isn't the most fortunate spot on the planet for you. Or you may fear you'll look at your astrocartography chart and feel like you have to high-tail it to the U.K. because you're certain your Uranus MC line there could bring about the professional change you've been wanting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the flip side, you could be so ready for something new, lucky, or exciting that you're fired up to go wherever your strongest lines might fall, practicality be damned. However, just as with all astrological concepts, practical application of astrocartography is nuanced.</p><li>"It's not always practical to move to your strongest astrocartography places," acknowledged astrologer April Elliott Kent of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Big Sky Astrology</a>. "But sometimes you can benefit from those places anyway."</li><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, you might log in to LinkedIn only to find out you've been messaged by a potential, thrilling client who lives in a faraway destination where one of your strongest, most positive lines falls. Maybe in the midst of using Tinder Passport, you match with someone who's based where you have a sexy Mars or romantic Venus DC line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Kent noted, "Surprising offers can come to you from a city where positive planets are strong in your astrocartography."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although astrocartography may make it seem as though your fate has already been written in the stars, you can think of it more as a weather forecast — helpful insight on what you&nbsp;could&nbsp;expect to be working with when you travel or move to a certain location. Ultimately, how you apply the knowledge offered by your unique map is entirely up to you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvArKurp5OWv7W7xquYqaCp</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fastrocartography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fastrocartography.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fastrocartography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fastrocartography.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fastrocartography.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fastrocartography.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./scorned-mother-five-34-fatally-shot-cheating-boyfriend-27-video-called-lover-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./scorned-mother-five-34-fatally-shot-cheating-boyfriend-27-video-called-lover-html.html>Scorned mother-of-five, 34, 'fatally shot her cheating boyfriend, 27, then video called his lover'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./423713-20-opening-prayers-worship-church-service-meetings-html.html>20 best opening prayers for worship, church service and Bible study</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./423713-20-opening-prayers-worship-church-service-meetings-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
