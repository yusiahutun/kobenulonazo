<time>13 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>You may know him from his legacy as Superman, but this </span><i><span>Man of Steel is</span></i><span> a highly regarded British actor known for his talent, versatility, and striking looks. But besides his superhero personality, Henry Cavill’s dating history has caught the audience’s attention.</span></p><p><span>Born on May 5, 1983, in Jersey, Channel Islands, Cavill began his acting career in the early 2000s and has since appeared in a number of projects like </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span> series, where he plays the lead role of Geralt of Rivia and </span><span>Sherlock Holmes in the Netflix film Enola Holmes.</span><span> Cavill’s talent, combined with his charm and charisma, has solidified his status as a “hunk” among women everywhere. But, there are a select few women who have been looking to date him. Here’s a look at Henry Cavill’s dating history and some of his notable relationships.</span></p><p>Everything we know.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.422099915326><h2>Natalie Viscuso (2021-present)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1503423925.jpg><p>Henry Cavill is currently in a relationship with TV executive Natalie Viscuso, whom he began dating in 2021 though the duo allegedly met years ago while filming Enola Homes in 2018-2019. Viscuso was a former star of MTV’s My Super Sweet 16, and has been a huge supporter of Cavill and his profession. In fact, in an interview with <a href=#>Deadline</a>, Cavill gushed about how his girlfriend helped him gain confidence as an actor.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think lately, my partner, Natalie Viscuso, has given me so much confidence in myself because it can be tough being away from everything, and you’re always breaking your own performances down and trying to work your best, but she has been an incredible support system for me and really opened my eyes to a lot of things and opened a gateway for me to drive harder,” he said.</p><p>Despite being Instagram official since April 2021, the duo made a public appearance on the red carpet only recently at the October 2022 premiere of the Netflix film, Enola Holmes 2 in New York City. So far, things seem to be going peachy between the two and they are even collaborating to bring a Warhammer 40,000 adaptation to the big screen.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Lucy Cork (2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-821240532.jpg><p>Prior to his relationship with Viscuso, Henry Cavill was dating Lucy Cork, a stuntwoman and equestrian who he met while filming Mission: Impossible 6 in 2017 in New Zealand where Cork was Rebecca Ferguson’s stunt double. Cavill publicly gushed about the brunette on Instagram, in a now-deleted post that showed her sparring with a boxing coach accompanied by a personal caption. At the time, the duo went public with their romance for the first time with a trip to the Wimbledon Men’s tennis final. After less than a year together, the couple called it quits, though the reasons are unknown. Since their split, both individuals have continued to pursue their respective careers, leaving their dating history as merely a chapter in their lives.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.939226519337><h2>Tara King (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-513088500.jpg><p>Cavill was also romantically involved with Tara King, a student at Bristol University back in 2016 who he met at a London nightclub. Despite their age difference, with Cavill being in his 30s and King in her early 20s during the time they were together, their relationship garnered attention and Cavill publicly showed her his affection. In fact, the Superman star shared how King protected him in an exclusive interview.</p><p>“Tara allows me to be me and she doesn’t have a problem with that. She treats me like a normal human being…She’s there when I need looking after and the world is a little too heavy. Then she will happily take that weight for me and make sure that I am OK,” <a href=#>illustrated</a> Henry.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9025423728814><h2>Kaley Cuoco (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1495296836.jpg><p>Another member of Henry Cavill’s dating history is American actress Kaley Cuoco in July 2013 who he briefly dated. Cuoco is best known for her role as Penny in the hit television series The Big Bang Theory, though they were only romantically linked for a short period of time. In an interview on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>, the actress was asked by a fan whether “the Man of Steel” is “really made of steel”, to which she hilariously replied. “Oh my God. I don’t know. I never say, ‘I don’t know’ — I always have an answer — but I don’t know.”</p><p>Their romance quickly fizzled out and the duo parted ways amicably. Cuoco is currently with American actor Tom Pelphrey.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Gina Carano (2012-2013, 2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-162341630.jpg><p>Cavill had an on-again, off-again relationship with American actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano. They were initially together in 2012 and 2013 for eight months, and then briefly reconciled in 2014. The duo even adopted a dog together but then broke up for good after being spotted together in Italy. The reason for the split still remains unknown.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.8668407310705><h2>Ellen Whitaker (2009-2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1164557338.jpg><p>Prior to his rise to fame as Superman, Cavill was in a long-term relationship with Ellen Whitaker, a British equestrian and the two got engaged in May 2011. The duo were engaged for over a year before they called it quits in 2012.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe it when he asked me to marry him,” Whitaker had told the <a href=#>Belfast Telegraph</a> at the time. However, the separation was mutual and a very long time ago and since then Cavill has cleared moved on.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
