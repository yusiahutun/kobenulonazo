But Floridians don’t need to travel nearly as far to go for an exhilarating hike in the woods.</p><p class=p2>“Almost every Floridian is within an hour of the Florida Trail, yet no one knows we’re here,” says Jenna Taylor, program manager for the Florida Trail Association’s (FTA) central and south regions. “While we don’t have peaks, we have such beautiful sweeping views that are just as spectacular.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s2>One of only three National Scenic Trails contained in one state </span><span class=s1>(along with the Arizona Trail and the Ice Age Trail in Wisconsin),</span> the Florida Trail spans roughly 1,500 miles from the southern terminus in Big Cypress National Preserve to Gulf Islands National Seashore in the panhandle. Officially designated a National Scenic Trail in 1983, the Florida Trail allows nature enthusiasts to explore our state’s most remote and undisturbed areas, through cypress swamps and pine flatwoods, in search of ghost orchids, migratory birds, and the elusive Florida panther.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/Hike20-2021-on-the-Ocean-to-Lake-Hiking-Trail.-Photo-courtesy-Hannah-Campbell-1024x683.jpg><p class=p3>“We’re fighting a losing battle against developers, and remembering that we have these spaces is so important,” says Taylor, who, along with the U.S. Forest Service and a team of volunteers from local FTA chapters, maintains a portion of the trail and its offshoots (called spur trails) for recreational use.</p><p class=p3>While the 113-mile stretch around Lake Okeechobee is the only official section of the Florida Trail located in Palm Beach and Martin counties, several of its spur trails are much closer. Jonathan Dickinson State Park is home to the Green and White Trails, named for their corresponding trail markers. These trails bring day hikers over ancient sand dunes and through palmetto and oak hammocks and are maintained by the FTA’s Loxahatchee chapter (the Tropical Trekkers chapter maintains other spur trails throughout Martin and St. Lucie counties).</p><p class=p3>“I always caution new hikers that Florida is not just flat—there’s definitely a lot of diversity in the terrain—so they need to be prepared for that,” says Taylor, who also notes that the Florida Trail and its offshoots will likely be wet during hiking season from<br><span class=s1>October to March. “The sooner </span>you learn to embrace it and walk right through the water, the better,” she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/The-Ocean-to-Lake-Hiking-Trail-is-one-of-the-Florida-National-Scenic-Trails-spur-trails.-Photo-by-Alex-Freeze-768x1024.jpg><p class=p3>Hikers who are ready to get their feet wet should consider traversing the Florida Trail’s local hidden gem: the Ocean to Lake Hiking Trail (OTLHT). This 61-mile spur trail is marked with orange blazes and runs from Hobe Sound Beach to Lake Okeechobee, taking hikers through ecosystems that change roughly every mile. While there are several opportunities to hike short sections, FTA Loxahatchee chapter chair Janet Miller recommends backpacking (or “through-hiking”) the trail over several days.</p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“You don’t realize it until you’re out there, but there are so many beautiful wildflowers; there’s always something blooming,” says Miller, who has been volunteering with the Loxahatchee chapter since 2011 and is one of </span>several volunteers who mow, blaze, and other-<span class=s3> wise maintain the trail. “When you see the cypress trees and the bromeliads in bloom, it’s really unique and beautiful. The sound, the smell… There’s just something about it.”</span></p><p class=p3>Backpackers have several options for through-hiking the OTLHT. Experienced hikers can visit <span class=s2><i>loxfltrail.org</i></span> for a trail map and information on camping permits, prescribed burn closures, and hunting season dates. Beginners can either use the Loxahatchee chapter’s Meetup page to sign up for a volunteer-led group <span class=s1>trip (hiking and backpacking trips are free for anyone wanting to attend, though FTA membership is encouraged) or register for Hike2O, an annual backpacking trip cohosted by the FTA and Loggerhead Marinelife Center.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/Micco-Bluff-on-the-Florida-Trail.-Photo-by-Van-Tran-1024x683.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s1>“There will always be people who need and want to connect to the ocean in different ways,” says Hannah Campbell, an FTA volunteer activity leader and president of Loggerhead’s edu-cation division. “We thought a really cool opportunity to do that would be to take them on a hike and introduce them to the coastal ecosystems that are intrinsically connected to the ocean.”</span></p><p class=p3>Now in its fourth year, the 33-mile Hike20 trek covers roughly half of the OTLHT over three days and requires <span class=s1>participants to have their own backpack, tent, water-filtration system, and food. Nightly conservation talks led by Campbell and other Loggerhead staff and FTA trail leaders round out the long weekend, which takes place March 3-5 this year.</span></p><p class=p3>“We’ve created a space where participants can feel comfortable that they’re in good hands with trained and experienced people and that they’re not going to be ridiculed or shamed for having questions,” says Campbell. “It’s a good introduction to incorporate camping and backpacking into their lifestyle so they can reach some of these more inaccessible natural areas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/Ghost-orchid-819x1024.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s1>Unlike other FTA-led hikes, Hike2O is a fundraiser for Loggerhead’s Oceans of Opportunity initiative, which grants scholarship funding and support services to underserved and </span><span class=s3>underrepresented students in Palm Beach and Martin counties. “It’s not just about the people who participate, it’s also about building that legacy for the next generation and creating the opportunity to engage with their ecosystem and the ocean in a meaningful way,” Campbell says.</span></p><p class=p3>Campbell has hiked with the FTA since childhood and loves encouraging people to test their skills and learn more about their state’s public lands on a nearby trail. “I am definitely the person who is advocating that there is legitimate and beautiful hiking in Florida,” she says, adding that taking a naturalist course or reading about local flora and fauna before any hike is a good idea.</p><p class=p3>“A lot of people are drawn to the OTLHT because they like the challenge,” she says. “It’s a physical challenge, it’s an emotional challenge, it’s an adventure—but the fringe benefit to all of those things is building a positive relationship with adults in nature. Wild Florida can seem uninspiring to the untrained eye, but its ecosystems are incredibly unique and full of life if you look closely.”</p><p class=p2><i>Visit loxfltrail.org or trekkers.floridatrail.org to become an FTA member or register for a hiking or backpacking trip; </i><span class=s3><i>to learn more about Hike20, visit marinelife.org/hike.&nbsp;</i></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/CamelBak-Rim-Runner-X-22-Hydration-Pack-100-REI-Palm-Beach-Gardens-rei.com_-820x1024.jpg><h3>Gear Up</h3><p class=p1><i>Be prepared for wet terrain, unrelenting sunshine, and insects with these guide-recommended essentials</i></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>•</b></span><span class=s2><b> A small backpack or hydration pack</b></span> (like a CamelBak) can carry essentials like water and snacks during day hikes; a 50-liter pack will give you plenty of room for multiday hikes.

Two liters should suffice for a two-to three-hour hike. For longer hikes, a water-filtration system (Iike the Sawyer Squeeze) allows you to filter water directly from backcountry sources. Add an electrolyte powder to your filtered water to enhance the taste and replenish nutrients lost through sweat.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>•</b></span><span class=s2><b> Sunscreen and bug spray with DEET</b></span> should be applied before any hiking trip, even in overcast or dry conditions. A hat and neck buff add further protection from bugs and sun exposure.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>•</b></span><span class=s2><b> A sleeping pad </b></span>adds much-needed support when sleeping on the ground.

Please do your part to support and protect nature.</i></p><p class=p4><b>1. Plan ahead and prepare. </b>Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you’ll visit. Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies.</p><p class=p4><b>2. Travel and camp on durable surfaces. </b>Durable surfaces include maintained trails and designated campsites, gravel, sand, or dry grasses. Camp at least 200 feet from lakes and streams. Walk single file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy.</p><p class=p4><b>3. Dispose of waste properly. </b>Inspect your campsite for trash or spilled food. Pack all leftover food, toilet paper, and litter. Utilize toilet facilities whenever possible. Otherwise, dig a 6- to 8-inch deep cathole at least 200 feet away from water, camp, and trails.</p><p class=p4><b>4. Leave what you find. </b>Leave rocks, plants, and other natural objects as you found them. Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species.</p><p class=p4><b>5. Minimize campfire impacts. </b>Use a lightweight stove or established fire rings for cooking and keep fires small. Use only dead wood from the ground that can be broken by hand. Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then scatter cool ashes.</p><p class=p4><b>6. Respect wildlife. </b>Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow, approach, or feed animals. Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash securely.</p><p class=p4><b>7. Be considerate of other visitors. </b>Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail. Let nature’s sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLvUrZuop6KofKO4wLOcZqSfmK6tedOrmKKko2LEqsDHZpqoppaesaa6wp5m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblaze-local-trails-with-confidence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fblaze-local-trails-with-confidence.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fblaze-local-trails-with-confidence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fblaze-local-trails-with-confidence.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblaze-local-trails-with-confidence.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblaze-local-trails-with-confidence.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./st-patricks-day-soup-recipe-with-cheese-croutons.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./st-patricks-day-soup-recipe-with-cheese-croutons.html>Cook this tasty soup with shamrock cheese croutons for St Patrick's Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./article-d541eac5-ce8b-5932-88f5-36574df5e150-html.html>Momma McDaniel has to man up for heated campaign | Local News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./article-d541eac5-ce8b-5932-88f5-36574df5e150-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
