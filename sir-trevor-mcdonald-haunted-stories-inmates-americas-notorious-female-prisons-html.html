'I promised at that moment to keep him safe forever and I didn’t,' she said</b></span></p><p><span><b>And that makes me feel like a monster. And it makes me feel like I don’t even deserve to be alive some days.'<br></b></span></p><p><span><b>On day she killed her son she had been to see her psychologist. She then went home to sew a Christmas stocking for her baby.<br></b></span></p><p><span><b>'I sat working on the little felt pieces for his stocking for his first Christmas. It was just him and I that day and, I don’t know, he was fussy because he had a cold and, I don’t know, I lost my temper,' she said.<br></b></span></p><p><span><b>Hopkins describes performing CPR on her son whilst on the phone to the paramedics. She says they were rushed to hospital.<br></b></span></p><p><span><b>'I told them what happened,' she said. 'At that point all I wanted to do was save his life and it didn’t matter what happened to me.'&nbsp;<br></b></span></p><p><span><b>Hopkins’ son died of shaken baby syndrome. Trevor asked her if she has been classed as a baby killer by the other inmates.<br></b></span></p><p><span><b>'I was that,' she replied. 'I am that, but I’m a lot more than that as well, but that’s who I am.'</b></span></p><p><span>'And it may seem fake on the outside, but emotions and feelings are real. I’ve had a dozen relationships and two great loves. And I would say that I damaged both of them by being a cheater and a liar.</span></p><p><span>'It’s like being a kid in a candy store. This is the gayest place on earth.'</span></p><p><span>Among the most difficult of the stories heard by Sir Trevor is that of Cindy White, who has spent more time in prison than any other woman in the state of Indiana.</span></p><p><span>Thirty-eight years ago, when she was just a teenager, she became the youngest offender in the jail after killing six people that she lived with when she set the house on fire.</span></p><p><span>She has never driven a car, gone on a date, had a bank account or any children. She told Trevor she had been abused and started the fire as a cry for help.</span></p><p><span>'I knew that people were there, what I was thinking was, if I set a fire, then everybody can get out and I can run. That was my intention. The fire got out of hand,' she said.</span></p><p><span>As she has not had a family of her own, White and the other inmates explain that she has created her own family in jail. 'Here, you see what you get,' she said.</span></p><p><span>'We’ve all been in the same boat; hurt; disappointed. Reach out to someone that’s walked in your shoes and it makes it easier.'</span></p><p><span>White said she has been refused parole several times and she now believes that she will spend the rest of her life in jail.</span></p><p><span>'I figure, if they haven’t let me go in 37 years that I have tried to go, they’re never going to let me go,' she said. 'So I have to make do with what with I have and make the best of it.</span></p><p><span>'I try to find someone worse off than me that needs a kind word, a hug.' White will never be released.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/25/article-2431714-183EF7DD00000578-899_634x448.jpg height=448 width=634 alt="Nowhere to run: Linda Darby, left, who killed her husband, spent 35 years as a fugitive after escaping from prison in 1972, remarrying and raising a family before the law finally caught up with her" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Nowhere to run: Linda Darby, left, who killed her husband, spent 35 years as a fugitive after escaping from prison in 1972, remarrying and raising a family before the law finally caught up with her</p><p><span>And then there is the case of Linda Derby.
