From a leaked recording of the former First Lady apparently ‘hating Christmas’ to reasons why she took several months to move in to the prestigious building, she heard them all. But there was one bizarre conspiracy theory that had her ‘laughing’ more than others.</strong></p><p>The model made her mark in the US before meeting and falling for hotel and <a href=#>real estate</a> mogul Donald. It’s said the first time her parents traveled from Slovenia to America, <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> asked them for her hand in marriage. <a href=#>Melania Trump</a> probably never imagined their lives would end up with in the White House, but it did.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-melania-trump-conspiracy-theory-revolving-the-white-house>Melania Trump conspiracy theory revolving the White House</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-845611482-1024x683.jpg><p>It’s no secret the mom didn’t move in with Donald when he was signed in as President of the United States. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> in her own right only packed up her things for her new above five months into his term.</p><p>At the time, people were suspicious why she didn’t want to start their new journey together under the same roof. However, Melania Trump came out to explain she didn’t live in the White House for the first several months because of their son <a href=#>Barron</a>. He was currently in fifth grade, and she didn’t want to uproot his schooling during the academic year, so they waited.</p><p>But the rumors didn’t stop there.</p><p>The big conspiracy theory that took over the internet apparently had her laughing ‘all the time’.</p><p>Despite overseeing State Dinners and other affairs as <a href=#>First Lady, Melania Trump</a> fans thought she didn’t actually live there – and pretended to do so. Internet sleuths believed she resided in a completely separate house somewhere in Washington, DC and lived with her parents and son. The strange rumor was even branded an “urban legend” by White House social secretary Rickie Niceta Lloyd.</p><p>Trump’s spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said: “We laugh at it all the time”.</p><p>Then White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders even said the notion Melania Trump lives somewhere else entirely was “ridiculous”.</p><p>She continued: “The First Lady lives here at the White House. We see her here regularly”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-first-lady-waited-five-months-to-move-into-her-new-home>First lady waited five months to move into her new home</h2><p>It wasn’t until June 2017 when Melania Trump and Barron finally moved into the White House. Once he finished fifth grade, he then started the new academic year at St Andrew’s Episcopal School, based in Potomac, Maryland.</p><p>Other rumors began to surface, claiming Melania’s parents, Viktor and the late <a href=#>Amalija Knavs</a> lived with them. This would mean they’d have a swanky pad in the White House, which most people can only imagine. But POTUS never responded to these claims.</p><p>We all know the <a href=# rel=nofollow>leaked recording of Melania</a> getting angry over the Christmas decorations also caused a stir.</p><p>The Washington Post then reported the couple didn’t eat or sleep together, having separate bedrooms. However, it’s been depicted through other presidencies that POTUS and the First Lady may have separate bedrooms due to late night meetings and state business.</p><p>White House staff then said Melania Trump had a great relationship with the butlers, chefs and staff around the residence. There’s more than 100 people working in the building keeping it running.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eDcLnEpZinoZFiwbPBzKlknKeeqL2qvsCcsGasmJq8s8WMrJ%2BeZZ6aw6a%2BjKWgr52UYravedOhnGavmJ7BpnnHqKysnV2irqWxjKGcq2WclsKotI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmelania-trump-conspiracy-theory-she-never-lived-in-the-white-house-made-her-laugh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmelania-trump-conspiracy-theory-she-never-lived-in-the-white-house-made-her-laugh.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmelania-trump-conspiracy-theory-she-never-lived-in-the-white-house-made-her-laugh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmelania-trump-conspiracy-theory-she-never-lived-in-the-white-house-made-her-laugh.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmelania-trump-conspiracy-theory-she-never-lived-in-the-white-house-made-her-laugh.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmelania-trump-conspiracy-theory-she-never-lived-in-the-white-house-made-her-laugh.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nicola-sturgeon-unearthed-wedding-photos-peter-murrell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nicola-sturgeon-unearthed-wedding-photos-peter-murrell.html>Nicola Sturgeon looks unrecognisable in unearthed wedding photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-air-drying-hair-bad.html>Is It Bad to Air-Dry Your Hair Instead of Using Heat?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./is-air-drying-hair-bad.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
