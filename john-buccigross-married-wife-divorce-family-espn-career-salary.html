When he moved with his parents to Steubenville, Ohio, at the age of 11, he got the chance to venture into the world of sports by first completing his education in this field. John first graduated from the Catholic Central High School in Steubenville before moving to Heidelberg College, where he studied communication and theater arts. Since then, the American citizen of white ethnicity has been active in radio journalism and has received numerous awards for his extraordinary abilities, especially as a sports reporter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>John Buccigross ESPN Career</strong></h2><p>John joined ESPN in 1996 and has been serving the satellite cable network for over two decades. He had his first professional job as co-host of the NHL 2Night show only a short time after graduating from Heidelberg College. His professional skills on the show earned him a nomination for the Emmy Award. His best television shows included Baseball Tonight and Sports Centre.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Burak Ozcivit Wife, Body Measurements, 5 Facts About The Turkish Actor</a></strong></p><p>John also served in Providence, Rhode Island, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, before he found himself on ESPN. Between 2001 and 2010, John was the author of ESPN.com’s weekly NHL column. During this time he also signed a contract with Middle Atlantic Press to write about the life story of former NHL player and analyst Keith Jones under the title Jonesy: Head down and skate: to write about the unlikely NHL career of Keith Jones. The book was published and released in October 2007.</p><p>In addition, John was also a member of the advisory board of the “you can play” campaign, which worked to eradicate homophobia among sports enthusiasts. During the 2012 NHL playoffs, he also hosted the #Bucciovertimechallenge on his Twitter handle, where followers were asked to solve the tricky quizzes.</p><p>To demonstrate his love and support for the sport of hockey, John Buccigross founded a hockey-related charity that sold T-shirts and caps to hockey fans and used the money raised from the sale to finance college students who wanted to build their careers in hockey. He won the GLAAD Media Award for an outstanding article on digital journalism.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family</strong></h2><p>Although he is a media personality, John has successfully managed to keep details about his family, including his parents and siblings, a secret. However, it is known that his father’s name is Edward Buccigross and his mother’s name is Mary Donovan. His mother gave birth to him at Allegheny General Hospital, and he grew up in nearby Indiana, Pennsylvania.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>John Buccigross’ Married Life – Wife, Divorce</strong></h2><p>The good-looking sportsman married his lovely Italian wife Melissa Buccigross in 1991 after many years of relationship. The couple exchanged vows in the Italian wedding style and have been living together as a married couple ever since. They also have three children – two boys named Brett Buccigross and Jack Buccigross and a daughter named Malorie Buccigross. The couple now lives in South Windsor, Connecticut.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ESPN anchor was recently involved in a high-profile sex scandal involving former ESPN analyst Adrienne Lawrence, who sued him for sexual harassment, claiming that he invited her to his home and tried to woo her on behalf of her mentor. She also claimed to have contacted the cable channel’s human resources department on this matter, but instead of resolving the matter, they tried to protect Buccigross’s reputation by covering up his intimidation intent.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Onision Wife, Kids, Age, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Is He Gay?</a></strong></p><p>Adrienne sent her a message from John via SMS, in which he allegedly said: “I am a white boy and I am robbed”, as evidence against him. The complaint also stated that John, along with other men on ESPN, was hitting on her female colleagues without any intervention by the company. While John has not yet issued a statement on the matter, the ESPN spokesperson denied all allegations.</p><p>Despite all the controversy, John Buccigross is still married to his Italian wife, he has never been married to another woman before, so he has never been divorced and he is not gay. Most interestingly, all three of his children are sports enthusiasts – his eldest son, Brett Buccigross, like his father, is a golf enthusiast and golfer, while his other two children, Jack and Malorie, are interested in football and horse riding respectively.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong><span id=John_Buccigross8217_Career_TV_shows_Salary_and_HisNet_worth>John Buccigross Salary and Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p>After his long and active years in the communications industry, John Buccigross has undoubtedly earned enough to remain on the celebrity list for years after his retirement. Although he has not yet talked about his annual income, it is estimated that his annual income will decrease by $250,000 while his net worth will be around $5 million. As proof of how much he is admired for his professional achievements, John has a massive following of over 400,000 on Twitter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kt7C0zWaZrpuTnrSzu9KsZKaZoqe2prCMsKCfnV2Ztre70ZycZp6RoratxYyeqqmmXZius7HEq2SsmZyWv7p7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-buccigross-married-wife-divorce-family-espn-career-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-buccigross-married-wife-divorce-family-espn-career-salary.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-buccigross-married-wife-divorce-family-espn-career-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-buccigross-married-wife-divorce-family-espn-career-salary.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-buccigross-married-wife-divorce-family-espn-career-salary.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-buccigross-married-wife-divorce-family-espn-career-salary.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./my-friend-the-silent-stalker.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./my-friend-the-silent-stalker.html>My Friend the Silent Stalker Coping with Cancer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./661508f2ca47419f088b456f-html.html>El Racing de Ferrol se ha convertido en un 'Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./661508f2ca47419f088b456f-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
