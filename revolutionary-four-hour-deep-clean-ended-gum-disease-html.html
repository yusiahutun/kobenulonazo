It is estimated that three-quarters of adults over the age of 35 have some form of the condition, with often irreversible consequences. It is caused by plaque, a film of bacteria which forms on the surface of the teeth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The disease begins as gingivitis, causing sore and bleeding gums due to inflammation. If caught early through proper cleaning and flossing, the condition can be reversed. But if it is left untreated, it can quickly develop into periodontitis, which Samantha had.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is a much more serious condition where the gums pull away from the teeth and space forms between the gum and the tooth. In a healthy mouth, the space between the gum tissue and its attachment to the tooth should be between 1mm and 3mm deep.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, if space grows any bigger than 3mm due to build-up of sticky bacteria, food particles can become trapped in them, allowing bacteria to flourish further – and, in turn, triggering a worsening infection.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At this point the increased space is referred to as a pocket and if it grows, bacteria can burrow deep into the gum, attacking tissue and bone and loosening the tooth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In that situation, tooth extraction or cutting the gums to release the trapped bacteria is the only option, as Samantha was warned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One of the problems with gum disease is that symptoms may not appear until an advanced stage. Healthy gums should be light pink and firm, and do not bleed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Over the years, Samantha suffered frequent sore, swollen and bleeding gums and was constantly on antibiotics. ‘I would have nightmares about losing all my teeth,’ says the star, who is married to actor Mark Womack.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And regardless of how meticulous they are with their dental hygiene, some people, such as Samantha, are still highly likely to suffer due to genetics.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘People are frightened to talk about gum disease because they think that having it is somehow dirty,’ she says. ‘But it can happen to anyone, irrespective of how often you brush your teeth.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition to poor dental hygiene, triggers include smoking, a high-sugar diet, diabetes, some medications and a weakened immune system.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;Gum disease is also increasingly being linked to a number of more serious conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and dementia.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As Samantha had family members who also suffered from the condition, her dental hygiene has always been ‘exceptional’, including regular check-ups.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-14a2db67c72a327b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/25/19/46AF90D700000578-5117105-image-a-4_1511637444072.jpg height=858 width=634 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But the prognosis dentists were giving me was very depressing – extractions or splitting the gums,’ she explains.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While researching holistic treatments, she came across BOST. Aimed at chronic sufferers, the treatment claims to eliminate periodontal disease at its source.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It tackles the area under the gums and near the bone supporting the teeth by aerating it and flushing out the bacteria that lurk there through intensive cleaning using metal instruments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bacteria are killed after being exposed to oxygen. And over time, this helps to close the pockets and reattach the gums to the teeth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As BOST does not involve cutting or stitching, it is less painful and also cheaper than implants. ‘We use a gentle gum-stretching technique to reach the root surfaces,’ explains Suzanne, who performs the procedure at the Hale Clinic in London.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She says: ‘Infected tissue is spongier and elastic, so it’s possible to stretch and push it back manually without cutting the gums, allowing access under the gum to cleanse the infected tooth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Every square millimetre of every tooth and root is cleaned as deep as any pocket reaches.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A key part of BOST is identifying the exact bacteria causing the infection, so a simple bacterial DNA test – where paper is inserted into the pockets around the teeth to get a sample – is performed. Armed with the information, the dentist can then decide whether antibiotics are necessary.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the same time, the pockets are measured to see how deep-rooted the infection is.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Of Samantha’s 30 teeth (she had had two wisdom teeth removed), 27 were infected with varying degrees of bacteria.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was also discovered that the pockets in her mouth were up to 9mm deep, rather than the healthy 1mm to 3mm.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ten days later, she underwent the procedure. Due to the depth of her pockets and volume of bacteria, she was prescribed antibiotics. However, this is necessary only in severe cases.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I didn’t feel any pain, just a little discomfort in certain areas, and there was quite a lot of bleeding and rinsing,’ she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The success of BOST also depends on maintaining a strict aftercare routine using a special instrument called a Perio-aid. The small plastic device is fitted with a set of disposable wooded heads that slot into the end.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Held like a small pencil, the Perio-aid can be painlessly pushed into the cleansed pockets to continually clean underneath the gums and get oxygen into them, killing any damaging bacteria.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I also advise patients about their lifestyle and diet,’ says Suzanne. ‘Stress overload and nutritional deficiencies can make you more prone to periodontal disease.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Having followed a treatment plan, Samantha is reaping the rewards. ‘My pockets now measure about 3mm to 4mm and my gums have reattached to the teeth, which is fantastic,’ says the actress, who has also appeared in the Sky One comedy-drama Mount Pleasant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Now I just have to keep up the maintenance with my Perio-aid and see the hygienist every four months. My mouth feels fresh and my gums aren’t bleeding. It is a lovely feeling.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>lBOST costs between £2,500 and £5,000. bostclinic.com</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6GyboGQam5qaGVkn6bCzqWsraGfo66zxYyfpq6qXZ28tr6MnZyeqF2YuaatzWacp5yVmXqowcxmm6KrlZbApnrHraSl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frevolutionary-four-hour-deep-clean-ended-gum-disease-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frevolutionary-four-hour-deep-clean-ended-gum-disease-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frevolutionary-four-hour-deep-clean-ended-gum-disease-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frevolutionary-four-hour-deep-clean-ended-gum-disease-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frevolutionary-four-hour-deep-clean-ended-gum-disease-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frevolutionary-four-hour-deep-clean-ended-gum-disease-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shania-twain-cmt-fashion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shania-twain-cmt-fashion.html>Shania Twain Stands By Her CMT Awards Fashion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daredevil-wildlife-workers-teach-wolves-tigers-hunt-trust-safe-html.html>Out of Africa park workers teach wolves and tigers to HUNT in Arizona</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daredevil-wildlife-workers-teach-wolves-tigers-hunt-trust-safe-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
