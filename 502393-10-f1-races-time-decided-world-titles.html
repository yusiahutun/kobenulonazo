Interestingly, the championship doesn’t have to come down to the year's final race to provide a great deal of drama. Throughout the races, drivers show fantastic skills, hard work, and determination.</p><h2>Best F1 races of all time that decided the world titles</h2><p class=align-left>This world championship has seen several hugely intense title battles over the years. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Divebomb</a>, these are some of the best Formula One races that decided the world titles.</p><h3>1. Brazilian Grand Prix, Interlagos, in 2012</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2ea3043c650907ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review for April 19: Bipartisan Talks Face Jeopardy as Raila Team Place New Demands</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel led the championship by a comfortable 13 points, coming into the final race in Brazil. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">battle came down to</a> the final race of the season, between Sebastian and Fernando Alonso. It was not without challenges because of the slightly damp track that only got wetter during the race.</p><p class=align-left>Sebastian was spinning on Lap 1 and, at some point, dropped to last place before romping back to a title-clinching number six. This was the main news story in Interlagos. Finishing sixth enabled him to secure his third title by three points.</p><h3>2. Australia 1986, Adelaide Street Circuit</h3><p class=align-left>The 1986 Australian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 26th, 1986, at the Adelaide Street Circuit, Adelaide, Australia. There weren’t two protagonists at play at the circuit, but three. They were Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet for Williams and Alain Prost for McLaren.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/757dc3a9828c9e12.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 Priceless Photos of Eldoret Residents Watching Boston Marathon on Big Screen</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mansell was the race's favourite. He took pole ahead of Piquet and Ayrton Senna, with Prost in fourth. Interestingly, Mansell ran a pretty steady race, not really trying to fight Senna, Piquet, and Prost. However, things didn’t go quite as Mansell had imagined.</p><p class=align-left>Nelson was forced to fight back through the field. He passed the relatively idling Mansell for the second 21 laps later. Prost suffered a puncture and dropped to fourth. However, despite the puncture himself earlier in the race, he took the championship by two points.</p><h3>3. Canadian Grand Prix, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, in 2011</h3><p class=align-left>The 2011 Canadian Grand Prix was the craziest F1 race held on June 12th, 2011, at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada. It was the seventh race of the 2011 Formula One World Championship and the 48th Canadian Grand Prix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2ea3043c650907ef.jpg><p class=align-left>Throughout the race, tranquility was scarce as the drivers frequently collided, spun out, and made errors. On the last lap, Jenson Button managed to catch up to the leading driver, Sebastian Vettel. However, Vettel's error caused him to go off course, paving the way for Button to seize the victory.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/17de77a95f162725.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 soccer movies on Netflix that you should watch in 2023</span></p></a><h3>4. European Grand Prix, Nurburgring, in 1999</h3><p class=align-left>The 1999 European Grand Prix was one of the title-deciding F1 races in the sport's history. It was held on September 26th, 1999, at the Nürburgring in Germany. The race was set to be crucial even before lights out.</p><p class=align-left>There was a tense championship battle between Eddie Irvine for <a href=#>Ferrari</a>, Mika Häkkinen for McLaren, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen for Jordan. When the race began, words weren’t enough to describe what had happened. It is undoubtedly the best F1 race to rewatch.</p><h3>5. 2020 Italian Grand Prix, Monza</h3><p class=align-left>The 2020 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on September 6th, 2020, at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. Pierre Gasly utilised a perfectly timed safety car during which the pitlane at first closed, bunching up the pack.</p><p class=align-left>The race gets more interesting when Sainz chases Gasly with a faster car. Gasly on his part, he is desperately trying to hold on. The two want to win their first Formula One victory. However, the race was won by Pierre Gasly, but it went down as one of the most exciting F1 races.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/114d7e3a8df4c052.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>You Are a Beast: Ruto Celebrates Eliud Kipchoge after Finishing 6th in Boston Marathon</span></p></a><h3>6. 1996 Monaco Grand Prix, Monaco Street Circuit</h3><p class=align-left>The 1996 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held in Monaco on May 19th, 1996. It was the sixth race of the 1996 Formula One season. This was a genuinely crazy race, definitely worth a watch.</p><p class=align-left>If not for the result, then for some of the bizarre incidents which eliminated driver after driver. Drivers like Katayama, Rosset, Diniz, Berger, and Brundle were expected to take advantage of circumstances that prevailed during the race. However, they all retired because of either personal errors or mechanical troubles.</p><h3>7. 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, Spa-Francorchamps</h3><p class=align-left>The 1998 Belgian Grand Prix is one of the best F1 races of the hybrid era. This motor race was held on August 30th, 1998, at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. It was the thirteenth race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/757dc3a9828c9e12.jpg><p class=align-left>The race was red-flagged, and clearing away all the debris took an hour before it could be restarted. It was continued with four drivers less and was won by Damon Hill.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cda72685494c0a76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Guinness World Records: Australian Man Smashes World Record with Over 3,200 Push-Ups in One Hour</span></p></a><h3>8. Mexican Grand Prix, Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, in 1990</h3><p class=align-left>This Mexican Grand Prix was a motor race held at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on June 24th, 1990. It was the sixth race of the 1990 Formula One World Championship and the 14th Mexican Grand Prix.</p><p class=align-left>Gerhard Berger featuring for Mclaren started on the pole, out-qualifying his teammate Ayrton Senna who started third. Ricardo Patrese featuring for Williams started in second. The race was quite interesting. Mansell finished second behind Prost. Berger came third.</p><h3>9. 2000 Japanese Grand Prix, Suzuka</h3><p class=align-left>This race was held on October 8th, 2000, at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka, Japan. Just past the halfway stage, Senna made his move on the home straight to take the lead after Prost was held up before pulling away comfortably.</p><p class=align-left>Senna eased to a then-record eighth win of the season to land the first of his three world championships.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d9c133be42f2dcca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 hottest female chess players to watch out for in 2023</span></p></a><h3>10. 1971 Italian Grand Prix, Monza</h3><p class=align-left>The 1971 Italian Grand Prix in Monza is the best F1 race of all time. As a result, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Monza will always</a> be a legendary track and will continue to be one of the crown jewels. This race featured the closest finish in Formula One history, as Peter Gethin beat Ronnie Peterson by 0.01 seconds.</p><p class=align-left>The top five were covered by just 0.61 seconds. Peter Gethin, Ronnie Peterson, François Cevert, Mike Hailwood, and Howden Ganley made the race more exciting. Interestingly, all of the drivers were yet to achieve their only win.</p><p class=align-left>These are some of the F1 races of all time that decided the world titles. Even though some happened more than 30 years, they continue to capture the attention of motor race lovers.
