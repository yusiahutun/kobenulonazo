But, there was one hearsay <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> was not having it, despite Jason’s insistence that it did, in fact, happen. According to his sibling, <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s</a> beau once got quite frisky and brave, stripping to his undies for a charity event.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-denies-stripping-at-fashion-show>Travis Kelce denies stripping at fashion show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1728649801-1024x683.jpg><p>Travis Kelce was relentlessly teased by Jason for apparently taking his clothes off during a charity catwalk event. However, Travis would not have it and said he never did it. He claimed by the time he became a junior (or senior) the college had stopped doing the fashion show … We wonder if someone has any photo or video evidence to back it up.</p><p>“‘I once stripped during a charity fashion show'”, Travis reads out from the card. “I actually deny this one.”</p><p>“Because by the time I got to this part of my … so I didn’t do the Bearcats Women’s 101 Day until I was like a junior or senior,” the NBA player said.</p><p>“What?! So?” <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> replied. “This was you,” Travis flips it on his brother firmly, “They stopped doing the fashion show by the time I went.”</p><p>“No, no, no. This was you,” Jason said.</p><p>“Dude, this was 1000 percent you. I did not strip!” said Travis.</p><p>“I remember this happening,” Jason responded.</p><p>“You remember this happening because you were a part of it. You were the one in the f****** jockstrap. This was not me,” Travis said. Jason, looking exacerbated replied: “Travis, this was you.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-is-convinced-jason-has-false-memoires>Travis is convinced Jason has false memoires</h2><p>“It’s not me,” Travis told him, “They got rid of it.”</p><p>“Alright, whatever,” Jason said, “I’ll confirm it because I know for a fact you did this at one point. You just don’t remember doing it.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> then tried to jog his brother’s memory by asking if he remembered being on stage with a friend called John Goble and being “in nothing but your underwear.” When his brother said no he laughed and said: “They switched it from a fashion show to a …”</p><p>“It might not have been a fashion show, but whatever it was, you stripped down. I remember this happening,” Jason insisted.</p><p>“This is so false,” Travis remarked.</p><p>“Nobody wanted to see me strip down,” Jason said.</p><p>Travis then referred to the much-loved movie starring Channing Tatum and said: “I’ve never Magic Miked anything.”</p><p>Except he has.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-modeling-career>Travis’ modeling career</h2><p>Travis Kelce has walked a <a href=#>fashion</a> show – though he was, in fairness, fully clothed. For a charity event involving his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, he strutted his stuff for Walk the Walk. The event is hosted by the boyfriend of music star Tay Tay, and there have been a handful of them.</p><p>He has walked the catwalk in aid of his charity foundation Eighty Seven and Running which “provides opportunities to disadvantaged youth and to help them aspire beyond their current situations. Kelce’s passion for changing the plight of youth experiencing adversity is the inspiration behind Eighty-Seven & Running.”</p><p>The charity was founded nearly a decade ago in 2015. They state on their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> they “help underserved youth strive to become productive citizens by mentoring and motivating them to explore and develop their abilities while learning critical life skills.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d%2FcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGarnpmjmrFurthmoZqrn6N6oq7OrqtmrJiaerW1zJ5koZ1dqbywt4yhoKxlk6G8tbTErGSonpZitq95xZqqoaGfo3q0tM6wZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-teased-by-jason-about-the-time-he-took-his-clothes-off-in-fashion-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-kelce-teased-by-jason-about-the-time-he-took-his-clothes-off-in-fashion-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-teased-by-jason-about-the-time-he-took-his-clothes-off-in-fashion-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-kelce-teased-by-jason-about-the-time-he-took-his-clothes-off-in-fashion-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-teased-by-jason-about-the-time-he-took-his-clothes-off-in-fashion-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-teased-by-jason-about-the-time-he-took-his-clothes-off-in-fashion-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./trp-report-week-5-anupamaa-continues-to-be-number-one-ghum-hai-kisikey-pyaar-meiin-and-jhanak-enter-top-5-1277258.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./trp-report-week-5-anupamaa-continues-to-be-number-one-ghum-hai-kisikey-pyaar-meiin-and-jhanak-enter-top-5-1277258.html>TRP Report Week 5: Anupamaa continues to be number one; Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin and Jhanak ente</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lakeyah-danaee.html>Lakeyah Danaee</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lakeyah-danaee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
