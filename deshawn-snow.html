She discovered that her husband was unfaithful to her. In May 2010, the couple filed for divorce.</p><h2><span id=DeShawn_Snow_Relationship_Boyfriend>DeShawn Snow Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>While DeShawn Snow was active in the dating scene following her divorce, there was no word on the boyfriend.
