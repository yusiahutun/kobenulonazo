I am edging towards my mid-50s and, like most middle-aged women, I can look a bit tired. I didn't want to look young, just refreshed, as if I'd had a good night's sleep.<br></p><p>I knew there was a downside to having the injections; the permanently surprised eyebrows, the scarily impassive face, but I thought that was the result of too many top-ups; Hollywood's addiction to permayouth.<br></p><p>As a professional beauty writer, I also knew Botox could go badly wrong, creating uneven eyebrows and lopsided frowns, but I thought that was budget Botox at a local beauty salon or foreheads needled at cut-price Botox parties where toxins are handed out as freely as wine.</p><p>I also knew that, in the right hands, Botox works like magic, so I took myself off to one of the top dermatologists in the country, 'Mr Botox' himself, Dr Jean-Louis Sebagh.</p><p>I interviewed him before having the treatment so didn't pay for it, but his normal rates for Botox start at Â£400. He says that to do good Botox 'you must be an artist with a needle'.<br></p><p>According to his website, he treats some of the most famous faces in the world and claims he doesn't just make women look younger, he makes them look better.<br></p><p>So it never occurred to me that I might look worse. Much, much worse.<br></p><p>Afterwards, my eyebrows were pushed so far down I looked constantly angry with a deep-set frown between my eyes.<br></p><p>It takes five days for Botox to set in and when it does, it sets like concrete. My face was stuck in a paralysis of hostility and there was nothing I could do to change my expression.<br></p><p>I looked so terrible a friend asked if I'd hit my head. I was too embarrassed to tell her it was self-inflicted. I felt like a vain and foolish idiot.<br></p><p>The headaches were terrible and the pressure on my eyebrows caused a build up of fluid that made my eyelids swell. I looked like a train wreck.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/24/article-1195270-0577ABD1000005DC-815_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Beauty confidential: How to look fab for a fiver</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/16/15/004D16C800000258-0-image-a-6_1455637424012.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Four beautiful women - and four startling images that show how THEY see themselves</span></a></li><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/24/article-0-0577FBD7000005DC-306_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>My year without sex!

I went back to see Dr Sebagh, who told me I had suffered an 'unfortunate side-effect' and there was nothing he could do. It would wear off eventually.<br></p><p>'No need to get so angry,' he said. I was close to tears. 'I'm not angry,' I said. 'You've made me look that way.'<br></p><p>But in my view he was unapologetic - offering no regrets, just a Gallic shrug and a bottle of eye drops because my eyes were a little closed. The eye drops did nothing. I knew they wouldn't.<br></p><p>I've had Botox before, just once, about five years ago, from another of the country's leading dermatologists, Dr Nick Lowe.<br></p><p>It was so good I wrote an article for a newspaper saying: 'Now we've got Botox, who needs expensive face creams?'<br></p><p>So it never occurred to me that, in expert hands, Botox could go so badly wrong. I knew the 'unfortunate' side-effect Dr Sebagh described is very rare (about one in 1,000).<br></p><p>It is said to happen when a little Botox slips down from the injection site into the eyelid muscle to cause it to droop so alarmingly the eye almost closes. That's where the eye drops help.</p><p>Eyelid droop usually only happens in the hands of a bad or inexperienced practitioner.<br></p><p>It wore off and five months later, I am back to normal. It's such a relief to have my smile back that I will never have Botox again, no matter how tired I look.<br></p><ul><li>Last night Dr Sebagh said: 'The vast majority of people who have Botox are pleased with the results and return for further treatment.
