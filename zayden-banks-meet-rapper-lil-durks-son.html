<time>26 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>From the moment Zayden Banks came into the world, it was inevitable that people would be curious about him. This curiosity is based on being the son of the famous rapper Lil Durk.</p><p>Lil Durk is a household name in the entertainment industry. The famous American rapper has been active in the hip-hop world since 2010. He ultimately rose to prominence in 2020 and has since gained the attention of millions of fans worldwide.</p><p>Born Durk Derrick Banks on October 19, 1992, the American rapper rose to stardom after his first Billboard Hot 100 entry with his single, Viral Moments, off his fifth studio album. His features with other famous rappers like Lil Baby and Drake propelled him to his first Billboard Top Ten entry and gained him a cult following of fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-17_6_50_58.jpg><p>However, fame and privacy do not go hand in hand, as being a famous rapper has a way of putting your family and kids in the spotlight.&nbsp;Zayden Banks, although a minor, gained the attention of his father’s fans. Fans are curious to know everything there is to know about Lil Durk’s mini-me, from the identity of his mother to his siblings and his age.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about the celebrity kid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Zayden_Banks></span>Who Is Zayden Banks?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zayden Banks is the third child and second son of American rapper Lil Durk. Like many celebrity kids, he is famous because of his father’s celebrity status. Born in late 2013, Zayden is an African American.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike his father, Zayden Banks enjoys the presence of his paternal grandfather, Dontay Banks. Dontay Banks, popularly known as Big Durk, has been a part of his grandson’s childhood and upbringing. Unfortunately, Dontay couldn’t do the same for his son, Lil Durk.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Dontay Banks was arrested for drug-related crimes when Lil Durk was barely a year old and was in and out of jail for most of his son’s life. As a result of his incarceration, Dontay Banks missed out on most of his son’s childhood. However, he is making up for it by actively being a part of his grandson’s upbringing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Lil_Durks_Second_Son></span>How Old Is Lil Durk’s Second Son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to several reports, the son of the Chicago-born rapper was born on November 5, 2013, meaning Zayden Banks is nine. Fans are curious to know the future of the famous rapper’s son. However, given his age, Zayden Banks has much growing up to do, and we cannot predict if he will follow in his father’s footsteps or forge a different path.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Zayden_Banks_Mom></span>Who Is Zayden Banks’ Mom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The identity of Zayden’s mom is unknown to the public. Although Zayden’s father has been romantically involved with several women since he rose to fame, he has managed to keep most of their identities from the public. As far as Lil Durk’s relationship goes, his first relationship was with Nicole Covone, the mother of his first two kids.</p><p>The pair sparked dating rumors in 2008 and separated years later when he started dating Tameka Kute. The famous rapper is engaged to his longtime sweetheart, India Royale. However, none of these women is Zayden Banks’ mom.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-17_6_51_25.jpg><p>Looking at his birth year, we can confirm that Lil Durk was with Zayden Banks’ mom around the same time he was with Nicole Covone. Whoever Zayden Banks’ mother is, she is one of the romantic partners the famous rapper has cloaked in secrecy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zayden_Banks_Has_Five_Siblings></span>Zayden Banks Has Five Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As earlier stated, Zayden Banks is the third child of the famous rapper. Lil Durk has six kids presently, which means he has five siblings. Two older siblings, Angela Banks and Bella Banks, who Lil Durk had with his then-girlfriend, Nicole Covone. In addition to his older siblings, he has three younger ones, Du’mier Banks, Skyler Banks, and Willow Banks.&nbsp;</p><p>Willow Banks is Zaydens’ youngest sibling and the third daughter of <a href=#>Lil Durk</a>. She is also the only child he has with his fiancée, India Royale.</p><p>The hip-hop star once revealed in an interview that he intends to have a large family of about ten kids. This means Zayden Banks might have more siblings in the future.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lil_Durks_Son_Has_an_Online_Presence></span>Lil Durk’s Son Has an Online Presence<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many celebrity parents relentlessly try to shield their kids from the negativity that comes with being exposed to the media. While others allow their kids to bask in the attention they get from being in the spotlight. The latter is the case for Zayden Banks.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-17_6_51_53.jpg><p>Despite being a kid, Zayden has a significant online presence, especially on Instagram, with over 2k followers. Despite having a private account, the adorable celebrity kid has gained the attention of his father’s fans, who follow his day-to-day activities on social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Zayden_Banks_Net_Worth></span>What Is Zayden Bank’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zayden is a young, school-going kid who still has a lot of growing up to do. Hence, he doesn’t have a net worth of his own. However, his dad, Lil Durk, is a famous rapper with a net worth of about&nbsp; $10,000,000, which means Zayden Banks is pretty well-off.</p><p>Zayden Banks, like <a href=#>Khaza Kamil Gates</a>, is one of the celebrity kids who has stolen the hearts of his father’s fans, and they cannot wait to see what the future holds for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kx6LFw56lZpqRo7i0ecyenK1lopa9sbHRZqOipF2ZwrO30maqqKZf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzayden-banks-meet-rapper-lil-durks-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzayden-banks-meet-rapper-lil-durks-son.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzayden-banks-meet-rapper-lil-durks-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzayden-banks-meet-rapper-lil-durks-son.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzayden-banks-meet-rapper-lil-durks-son.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzayden-banks-meet-rapper-lil-durks-son.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./becky-g.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./becky-g.html>Becky G- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts, Career, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ma-long-biography-playing-style-career-earnings-and-he-greatest-table.html>Ma Long: biography, playing style, career earnings and is he the greatest table tennis player of all</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ma-long-biography-playing-style-career-earnings-and-he-greatest-table.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
