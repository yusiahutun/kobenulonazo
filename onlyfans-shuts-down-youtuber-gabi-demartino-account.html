I owe it to you guys."</p><p>Gabi said she came across the since-pulled clip while looking through old home movies and said it was a video that brought "laughter and joy" to her family for years. She said she thought the "wont put my panties on" caption was "funny" and a reference to the clip itself, in which the 3-year-old DeMartino "ruined a family moment" by exclaiming her grandmother told her, "put your panties back on."</p><p>"It's not funny," she says now. "Never in a million years did I think something that I thought was so innocent could be looked in such an ugly way and I think that's where the problem lies. I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm so dis-attached with reality that it didn't even cross my mind that this could be viewed like this. That's a serious issue, it's not funny, it will never be funny and it's not okay and I'm really sorry."</p><p>"It was definitely a huge lack of my character and my judgement," she added. "If you know me, you know I would never condone anything like this. It really hurts to know the pain that I've caused for so many people, my family, my friends, my fans, my supporters, even people who have simply been triggered by my stupid, thoughtless action ... to everyone, I'm very sorry."</p><p>"I would never do anything to exploit or harm a child," she said, choking up. "I'm so sorry, truly, very sorry, this is a huge wake up call. I'm going to grow and learn from this and I will come out of this a better person and I will do better. This was really wrong."</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original post below</p><p>Gabi DeMartino is facing a torrent of criticism online after she attempted to sell a video of herself naked, aged three, on OnlyFans.</p><p>The YouTuber, famed for her impressions of Ariana Grande, offered the 35-second clip for $3.</p><p>Her suggestive tease on the site ‚Äî which is heavily used by adult performers ‚Äî was: "wont put my panties on".</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0c/4by3/2020/12/02/0c9f5e346d5e4ea49daedb00b17623cf_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>After being flagged by other YouTubers and members of the OnlyFans community, the site confirmed it shut her account down for "violating terms of service."</p><p>DeMartino, who does not normally share naked pictures of herself on the site, apologized on Twitter, claiming she was sharing a "goofy" home video with her fans, and admitting she hadn't thought the idea through properly.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>a childhood video of me on the phone sayin "Nani says put your panties back on" and jumping up and down laughing.
