Christmas is around the corner. I have been making my lists and checking them thrice. In fact, one could say that I have been a bit OCD in my list checking this time around. Here is what I want to know: Has nice been working out for me this year? Or do I want to go for naughty in 2009?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As I contemplate naughty versus nice, some experiences from this past year have been haunting me. For someone who lives and breathes nice, I look back at some moments in 2008 and wish I had invoked my inner bad girl at times. There is always that instant when my upbringing keeps me from saying what I am really thinking. My mother taught us to be polite and respectful. But what do you do if you have been confronted with an insult or a derisive comment? For example, a frenemy once said to me, "Oh, I love that necklace. It is so much prettier than the jewelry you normally wear." In my nice-girl head, I was thinking, Wow, so that's what you call a mean compliment. But what if Naughty Girl were to respond? What would Naughty Girl say?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I am so conditioned to be nice, I can't even think of a response to write here, months after that comment. And here is my point: Why is naughty naughty? Isn't it just empowerment of a sort? If naughty means being mildly rude, well, that's not really for me. I can't be rude or mean. But if by another definition it means busting someone on bad behavior, I'm all for it. Being in the moment and allowing yourself a second to consider the best, most truthful response is my kind of naughty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A while ago, someone who I had worked long and hard with on something dismissed my hard work with a casual "So when are you going to show me what you have done?" <i>After</i> I had just presented it. <i>After</i> eight weeks of work. Nice Girl listened to what this person's ideas were, nodded her head, and knew she was on her way to getting a migraine. Naughty Girl may have been able to stand up and communicate clearly that she had just presented her work and that this response was insulting and unacceptable. I can hear the crackle of Naughty's illusive whip as she snaps her coworker to attention with her imaginary directness. (Nice is so ingrained in me that just writing that sentence made me nervous. Snap, crackle, and whips. If only there were a breakfast cereal for empowerment.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nice isn't wrong. Nice is good. It's...nice. I respond to nice. I wish more people were nice. If naughty equals bad behavior, I prefer nice. I am always voting for nice. When <i>American Idol</i> is on and there are two people left, I always want the nice one to win. Sometimes they are both nice, and then I wish for naughty so I could vote for nice. The issue is that most people are not nice the way I expect or hope for them to be. There is truth to that expression "No good deed goes unpunished." And sometimes that good deed can come back to bite you in the butt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because nice girls can't say no, they sometimes find themselves doing things they don't want to be doing. I can't tell you what these things are because then the people I did the nice things for would know that I didn't really want to be doing them but did them...to be nice. And even though I may not have wanted to do it, I do feel better when all is said and done. I just wish I could do everything that was asked of me without some other things suffering because of it. Like my sanity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So what should our naughty and nice girls wear? Even though I write <i>girls,</i> they are women. <i>Girl</i> just sounds better when matched with <i>naughty</i> and <i>nice.</i> Naughty woman? Not so much fun. Nice woman? <i>Boorrriiinnggg...zzzz.</i> Naughty Girl gets to wear some fun clothes. The fall collections showed a lot of black, a lot of sheer, a lot of tight, and a lot of low. There is no way you could put on anything from the above list and not feel just a little bit naughty. Nice Girl gets to wear all the soft colors, ruffles, and prints and always looks comfortable. Nothing too tight because those rosy cheeks on Nice Girl are a result of pleasantness, not a corseted waist. Blouses with bows, dresses with buttons, pastel colors, and a cozy sweater are all worn by Nice Girl. I like that look. Sometimes I wear that look. But I tend to like naughty clothes more than nice. I always have. Maybe my inner Naughty has been expressing herself through my wardrobe. I mean, even my workout clothes are black.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With 2008 almost over and 2009 around the corner, if a change is going to be made, now is the time to start thinking about it. December gives us a chance to reflect on the year that has just passed. We can make our own mental movie of the year-end inventory, editing the best and the worst of 2008, observing the montage of what we have learned, and cutting anything that isn't working for us anymore. And if, in January, we want to make resolutions, what will we keep and what will we want to change?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think I am going to give naughty a try in 2009. After all, maybe there's a little naughty in each of us that needs to be explored. Maybe Nice can be on one shoulder, halo and all, while Naughty stands on the other, whip poised for action and ready to snap.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I guess I have answered my question. I am going to redefine in 2009. Look out, folks; Naughty has arrived.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaa2RsfK%2Bt1KCfrbFdpL9uusicnGZpYmWFcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnaughty-or-nice-1208.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnaughty-or-nice-1208.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnaughty-or-nice-1208.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnaughty-or-nice-1208.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnaughty-or-nice-1208.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnaughty-or-nice-1208.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-sofas-buying-guide-top-trends.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-sofas-buying-guide-top-trends.html>Ultimate best sofas guide for 2024: The top trends, sofas and brands this year</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./meghan-markle-jewellery-earrings-crawlers.html>Meghan Markle just wore a daring fashion item no other royal has stepped out in, EVER</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./meghan-markle-jewellery-earrings-crawlers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
