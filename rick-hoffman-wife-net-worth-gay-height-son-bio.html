It was also in New York, Roslyn Heights, where he grew up with his younger brother Jef. He was born and raised by his Jewish parents Gail and Charlie Hoffman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rick-Hoffman-640x383.jpg><p>For his education, Rick Hoffman attended the Wheatley School for his high school education. From there he went to the University of Arizona for a study program. During his student days, the actor was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) Fraternity.</p><p>After graduating from university, Rick made his way to Los Angeles, California, where he decided to advance his acting career.</p><p>It didn’t apply to the actor as he had planned, and without any other plan, he spent many years waiting for restaurant tables. When finally an audition came and he got a role in suits, <a href=# rel=noopener>he revealed it that way</a>:</p><p>“I was hysterically crying in the middle of a park in San Francisco where I was on location doing a small (TV) guest role and I can’t tell you the feeling. I could cry now. It was this euphoric… like, thank you, God.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rick-Hoffman-Bio.jpg><p>His acting career began in 1997 when he took on a role in the film Conspiracy Theory. While he was performing, his role wasn’t quite massive because he played the role of a security guard. Next, he played the role of a policeman in the 1998 Lethal Weapon 4.</p><p>From then on the actor appeared again and again in movies and TV shows. But in 2011 he got his big breakthrough when he took over the main character in Suits, which is still running.&nbsp;Over his years in the industry, the US sitcom star has starred in over 40 lead and supporting roles in productions.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Winston Beigel Height, Wiki, Bio, Measurements, Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Rick had a dream of becoming an actor and, after obtaining his degree, made the move to Los Angeles in his late twenties. Despite high expectations for success soon after arriving in LA, Rick faced many hardships along the way. To pay rent he worked as a restaurant server and took on small roles such as police officer in Lethal Weapon (1998) and James Lockridge in Blood Work (2002).</p><p>Although these roles were appreciated by fans they weren’t enough to satisfy Rick’s ambition. After years of struggling with minor parts, he finally achieved success when he landed a major role on Suit following an impressive audition back in 2014 – something that almost seemed impossible at times during his career journey!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rick-hoffman.jpeg><p>Rick’s career was given a much-needed boost when he landed the role in the iconic sitcom, an experience that was incredibly emotional for him. As Rick sat alone in a park near where he had been filming another minor TV guest spot, his tears of joy and gratitude were uncontrollable.</p><p>His co-starring with Meghan Markle gave his career even more height and recognition as fans around the world began to take notice. Now considered one of Hollywood’s most reliable stars, Rick has gone on to star in over 35 movies across both major and minor roles; cementing himself as one of show business’s greatest talents.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Tom Pelphrey Married, Wife, Gay, Height, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=is-rick-hoffman-gay><strong>Is Rick Hoffman gay?</strong></h2><p>First of all, it is important to make it clear that although the 53-year-old star has not tried to deny it, there is no indication that Rick is gay. Only that he played the role of a gay man in the short film “Our Time Is Up”, which was shot in 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rick-Hoffman-Wiki.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=wife-son><strong>Wife, Son</strong></h2><p>Although Rick Hoffman has a son, there is no evidence about Hoffman’s Wife and his son’s mother has remained a very big secret. This remains so three years after the birth of his son in December 2014.</p><p>The only thing that is known about her is that she is no longer with the movie star, although, as he revealed in an interview, they are still best friends.</p><p>Looking at his relationships, there have been rumors that the actor is with British soap star Stephanie Waring after they were discovered over lunch in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rick-Hoffman-and-Stephanie-Waring.jpg><p>The rumor was further sparked by some messages from the duo on Twitter. The truth behind the rumor still remains hidden, as neither the father of one nor the actress who is the mother of 2 children has stepped forward to confirm or deny the rumor.</p><p>That was the only relationship that was connected with the actor. Considering how he was able to keep his son’s mother private, no one should be surprised that nothing is known about his relationships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=spouse><strong>Spouse</strong></h2><p>Rick Hoffman is not married and has never publicly disclosed any details about his personal life, including his dating history. However, he does have a son, who was born in 2012. The identity of the child’s mother is not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=education><strong>Education</strong></h2><p>After completing his high school education at The Wheatley School, Rick Hoffman moved to the University of Arizona to pursue a degree. During this time, he was an active member of the Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) Fraternity. After graduating from college, he relocated to Los Angeles in pursuit of a career in acting; however, things didn’t go as planned and it took several years working as a waiter before getting the chance to audition for Suits.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kevin Hart Bio, Wiki, Early Life, Height, Weight, and Waist</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=height><strong>Height</strong></h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Rick-Hoffman-height.jpg decoding=async alt="Rick Hoffman height" width=768 height=431 title="Rick Hoffman Wife, Net Worth, Gay, Height, Son, Bio" data-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></strong></h2><p>A well-built man, <strong>Rick Hoffman has a height of 5 feet 10 inches (1.77&nbsp;m)</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=net-worth><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>After spending many years in Hollywood, it would only be right to say that Rick has paid his dues in full.
