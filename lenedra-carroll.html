When she married Atz, who was also a singer, the couple started making music together.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;At the time, Lenedra only helped in the album and singing of Atz. She also released some of her albums, but there is not much information on her albums.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When she divorced Atz, Lenedra left singing completely and went on to become an author. On the side, Lenedra also started doing some personal work to earn money.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Carroll returned to music when she became her daughter’s manager and singer, Jewel Kitcher. In 2007, Lenedra released a new album, Beyond Words which became decently popular.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lenedra Carroll released another album with her daughter Jewel Kitcher two years later.

After that, Lenedra started writing books and became an author.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lenedra released the very popular book “The Architect of Abundance” in 2012, which is still one of the most popular books in the world.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite the rift between Lenedra and Jewel, they remained together for the NGO “Higher Ground for Humanity.” Lenedra’s NGO deals with clean water and healthy food and transports them to the needy and poor.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Awards></span><strong><span style=text-decoration:underline>Awards </span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lenedra Carroll is a popular singer, author, and entrepreneur.

After the divorce from Atz Kilcher, Carroll left the entire family and even her children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Atz started abusing his children and became an alcoholic. At the time, Lenedra never returned to her children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, the controversy did not end there; when Jewel became a successful singer, Lenedra returned. Lenedra became the manager of Jewel, which even took them to court.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But the twist was still to come as Jewel fired Lenedra abruptly. At the time, Jewel did not reveal the reason she fired her mom.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But later in her autobiography, Jewel stated that Lenedra had been stealing millions from her.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Not only that, but Lenedra also left Jewel with lots of debt. In an interview, Jewel revealed that she was so happy when her mom returned, but it has been a nightmare ever since.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the other hand, Lenedra has not commented anything about the allegations to date.</span></p><p>Likewise, in 1998, Jewel’s former manager, Inga Vainshtein filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against Jewel and Carroll.

There was also no news that either Lenedra or Atz were cheating on each other. The surprising thing in all of this was Atz got custody of all the children, but Lenedra did not even protest.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Lenedra left her entire family to go and live in solitude. After the divorce, Atz turned to alcohol and abused his children.
