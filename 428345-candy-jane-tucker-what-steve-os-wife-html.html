He is a renowned British-born American television personality, stunt performer, <a id=https://tuko.co.ke/416152-10-greatest-black-comedians-70s-funny.html href=#>comedian</a>, and entertainer. Steve-O is famous for his appearances in television series such as Jackass, Wildboyz, High Chaparelle, and others.</p><h2>Candy Jane Tucker and Steve-O's relationship</h2><p class=align-left>Candy and Steve-O met before he had his big break in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> industry.

The show first aired in 2003 on the Kanal 5 network. In most of his interviews, Steve did not shy away from confessing that Candy was the love of his life.</p><h3>What happened to Steve-O and his wife?</h3><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, their relationship did not have a happily ever after ending as they parted ways in 2003. Fans were left with more questions than answers because Candy and Steve were deeply in love with each other, and they seemed inseparable. So what caused the divorce? Candy cited Steve's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">addiction to drugs </a>and alcohol as the reason for the divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg><p class=align-left>Steve-O reached a point where he started suffering the consequences of his addictive behaviour. He began hearing voices in his head and even suffered from psychosis. His addiction to cocaine got out of hand as he was arrested and jailed by Swedish police when he was found guilty of narcotics smuggling and possession of illegal drugs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f3a30113f478899d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all rappers who died in 2021: From DMX to Biz Markie</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After he was released from prison, the pair lived in an apartment in California.
