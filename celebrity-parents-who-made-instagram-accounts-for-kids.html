News. "On her Instagram, it's all Chanel lovers. What I've noticed on my page is that I’m the one with haters. I'm the one that people want to get on. It's nice to go to a page and have not one negative thing on there. I didn't know it was out there, but she's now up to 400,000 followers and knowing that they are all lovers, it makes me believe that there's hope for humanity."</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Heidi Montag</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Spencer Pratt</strong></a></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>When Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt welcomed their son Gunner in 2017, they made him an Instagram account so fans could watch him grow up.
