This kind of abuse takes place when the harm is inflicted by the abuser through third parties towards the victim. Physical, sexual, economic, and emotional abuse is a part of intimate, partner or domestic violence that is encountered between parents/caregivers and children or intimate partners. Examples of emotional abuse consist of circulating false information or lies about the victim to their loved ones, calling upon the authorities with untruthful or insincere information, and also destroying the career of the victim by&nbsp;conversing with their employer(s). The bully or perpetrators might even turn the children of victims against them in certain situations.&nbsp;</p><p>Each action of the abuser is targeted to cause harm, isolate, and make the victim fearful; which ultimately can result in feelings of humiliation and lowering their self-esteem which influences the victims severely. It is essential to note that the term abuse by proxy is an under-researched concept, with limited articles by scholars identifying this type of emotional abuse. Thus, in this article to understand this concept, the perspective of narcissistic and domestic abuse will be further explored.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span>Domestic Violence and Emotional Abuse:</span></h3><p><a href=#>Domestic violence </a>and intimate partner violence is a concern that influences the lives of millions every year.

Besides this many people fail to understand emotional abuse in intimate partner violence and domestic violence. Isolate is the most common way of emotional abuse in relationships that include violence and abuse. This is achieved by the abuser by ruining the closest relationships of the victim.</p><p>An instance of this would be informing the family or friends of the victim that they are out of control, or vandalizing the work of the victim. This kind of activity by the abuser prolongs the nature of abuse by including others as well, thus, making it tougher for&nbsp;the victim to notice the abuse and ask for help or assistance. This all leads to giving the perpetrator more command over the life of the victim.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span>Association of Narcissism with Emotional Abuse:</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Support-and-Help.jpg><p>Research has represented that the ones who are diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) have traits that orient with the characteristics of that person who causes intimate partner abuse.
