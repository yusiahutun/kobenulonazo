Active ingredients like glycolic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid further play a great role in minimizing the appearance of ingrown hair. To sum up, pick a product with ingredients that are helpful in preventing or eliminating your current concern.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b) Formula- </strong>Choose a product with mild granules that are not harsh on the skin and doesn't cause any irritation. Also, the more moisturizing the formula is, the better! The product should address the problems without stripping away the natural oils from your skin. Adding to that, a hydrating exfoliator not only ensures smooth shaving, but it also lessens the chance of inflammation and irritation post shaving.</p><p><strong>c) Skin Condition</strong>- Be mindful about the skin conditions. If you already have sensitive skin, avoid ingredients like paraben, SLS, and harsh chemicals that can worsen your skin further. Also, it needs to be kept in mind that people who deal with excess production of estrogen or hormonal imbalance, may have more discoloration than the others. Thus, it is best to opt for a chemical exfoliator that is known to be milder and more effective.&nbsp;Our contributor Maya Adivi, states that hormonal imbalance breakouts can be seen in a lot of different ways, so it's always good to start by seeing a doctor or endocrinologist to treat the underlying problem. She says, “As for the skin, gentle cleansing, moisturizing, and using sunscreen is always a safe bet. If hormonal imbalance is breaking you out, adding a salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide based treatment is a good first line of treatment against acne.”</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Ta-da!
