He parted ways with the MTV franchise after splitting with Jenelle Delp, the last of him on TV. So, what happened to Kieffer Delp after his time at <i>Teen Mom</i>?</p><h2>Kieffer Delp and Jenelle Evan’s relationship</h2><p class=align-left>Kieffer and Jenelle had a public relationship that was shared on TV. The former couple met on <i>Teen Mom 2</i> and were introduced to each other through a mutual friend. The <i>Teen Mom</i> stars dated for a while before breaking up and moving on with their lives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a986914dce46e314.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Terence Creative, Size 8 Grace MC Price and Chacha's Engagement Dinner Party</span></p></a><h3>In what episode does Jenelle meet Kieffer?</h3><p class=align-left>Jenelle Evans met Kieffer Delp at the beginning of <i>Teen Mom 2</i> when Jenelle visited her friend's house. They stayed out together all night, and sooner rather than later, they hit it off. Kieffer and Jenelle started<a href=#> dating </a>and became a couple, but not everyone was a fan of their relationship, including Jenelle’s mother, Barbra.</p><p class=align-left>It was because Kieffer from <i>Teen Mom </i>got her daughter on drugs. Jenelle Evans was hooked on heroin while dating Kieffer Delp, and using the drugs often got the couple into trouble with the law.</p><p class=align-left>One time on the show, Jenelle’s mother was fighting for the custody of Jenelle’s first son because she suspected Jenelle and Kieffer to be smoking at the front porch of her house. She went on to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accuse them of being high</a> in her house. Kieffer Delp and Jenelle Evans also struggled with drug-related arrests while they were dating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0952aded625a3584.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kim Kardashian Flaunts Photos with Lover Pete Davidson Looking Glamourous at White House Dinner</span></p></a><h3>The break-up between Kieffer Delp and Jenelle Evans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a986914dce46e314.jpg><p class=align-left>The <i>Teen Mom </i>couple had a seemingly on and off relationship when they were dating. Their relationship lasted for two years, and it was coupled with a lot of ups and downs that led them to first break up in May 2011.</p><p class=align-left>Jenelle Evans began dating Gary Head in January 2012, but the relationship couldn't stand for a while. After four months, Gary broke up with Jenelle, stating that she was back together with Kieffer Delp with proof. Jenelle confirmed it was true, and they dated for a month.</p><p class=align-left>Jenelle got back together with Gary in May 2012 but broke up shortly with accusations of cheating, vandalism and felony theft. She got back with Kieffer Delp in July 2012 and went to New Jersey to be with him. Unfortunately, it did not work out, and they had to break up in September 2012 officially.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ba1fb49a23930fe0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Bobbie Jo Stinnett's daughter, Victoria Stinnett?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kieffer Delp and Jenelle Evans crossed paths again in 2016. They tried giving the <a href=#>relationship</a> another shot but noting they were on and off kind of people; it didn't see past that year. The two went their separate ways ever since, with Jenelle Evans getting married to David Eason.</p><h3>What happened to Kieffer Delp? Post-break-up, Kieffer Delp getting arrested</h3><p class=align-left>Kieffer Delp saw his reality shift quickly from being a TV personality to a drug dealer and felon. He found himself in legal trouble when he was no longer involved with Jenelle Evans. He was arrested on January 10, 2018, after the police searched his apartment in Pennsylvania and found a meth laboratory.</p><p class=align-left>Kieffer from <i>Teen Mom</i> agreed to a plea bargain to serve 18 to 36 months in jail and probation for three years. He honoured his sentence and was released from prison in February 2020. However, the police were on his trial six days after his release for jumping bail. He was arrested in Salem, New Jersey and was released after posting bail.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e7e8316f133fdce2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>DJ Creme Spends Weekend with Kids, Thanks Estranged Wife for Making It Happen</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It occurred that Kieffer from <i>Teen Mom</i> could help keep away from trouble. He was in police custody once again in October 2020. Furthermore, the former TV personality was arrested, and this time it was for going against his parole rules.</p><p class=align-left>Kieffer Delp was termed an “absconder” for failing to report to his parole officer. For this, he got locked up for six months in a correctional facility in Pennsylvania. He was released in March 2021 after doing his time at the correctional facility.</p><h3>The release of Kieffer Delp from prison</h3><p class=align-left>Kieffer Delp couldn’t hide his excitement of being released and went to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> his Twitter account</a> to let the <a href=#>world</a> know that he was back. He tweeted,</p>For nobody that thought I was going to max out my bid in the DOC [Department of Corrections] and not write no pieces [sic] yu had it f**ked up.
