This is because leather comes from an animal which requires large amounts of energy to produce the feed it eats, while emitting climate-warming methane gases and polluting effluents. By contrast, petroleum-based products such as polyester, acrylic, nylon and polyurethane fare much better.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, critics say the index doesn’t consider how consumers use clothes, or what happens to them when they are discarded.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A woollen coat, for example, is likely to be worn for longer than a synthetic one and, during its lifetime, will not leach plastic microfibres into the ocean.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The hope is that future materials will solve these problems.

People are trying to dump low-cost real fur as fake to capitalise on faux’s popularity.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Andrew Knight, animal welfare and ethics professor at University of Winchester, says: ‘Clearly the mechanisms retailers have in place for inspecting suppliers are not working.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He says it’s this that is driving unscrupulous suppliers to mislead retailers. Under the EU Textile Products Regulation (2011) in order to sell clothing containing animal fur such as chinchilla, mink or fox in Britain it must be clearly marked ‘contains non-textile parts of animal origin’. But shoes and accessories such as handbags and key chains are exempt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Most people would be shocked to learn that there’s no legal requirement for an item with real animal fur to tell you on the label that it is real animal fur,’ says Claire Bass.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Humane Society International recommends three tests for concerned consumers to check if faux fur is what it is claims to be.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>First, look at the ends of the fur which tend to taper at the end if real.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Second, look at the fur’s base which, if real, will be an animal skin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last, burn a few hairs.
