<time>22 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Although video games provide some of the best value-per-dollar for entertainment, gaming can be an expensive hobby. Those purchases add up, and it's easy to spend upwards of $1,000 in a year.</p><p>Fortunately, if your budget is tight, you have ways to cut back. First and foremost, stop pre-ordering games. You could even take it one step further and avoid buying new games altogether.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>However, the best idea of all is to wait for deals. You'll need some patience, and you won't always get to play the games you want right away, but video game deals can save you lots of money. To help you out, you should use game discount sites to help you find great deals on games.</p><p>With that in mind, here are the best sites to buy cheap video games.</p><h2 id=is-there-any-deal>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is There Any Deal</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/is-there-any-deal.jpg><p>Is There Any Deal is a deal comparison site for video games. It not only aggregates pretty much every video game deal currently available, but lists them all side-by-side and ranks them by how much you can save. Just search for the game you want, then view all the deals on its page.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Other nifty features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Wait for a better price:</strong> Set a price point and get alerted when the price drops below it.</li><li><strong>Price history:</strong> See if the game's current price really is a deal or not.</li><li><strong>Trends</strong>: See how quickly the game has sold.</li></ul><p>If price is your only criterion, then this site is what you need. But Is There Any Deal also lists stores selling the game without deals. This allows you to use the site as a "where can I buy this game?" tool, regardless of deals.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=cheapshark>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheapShark</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cheapshark.jpg><p>CheapShark only aggregates video game prices from a dozen or so online retailers, but lets you search for any game and gives you a quick comparison of what it costs at each one.</p><p>Two features you'll find useful: <strong>Cheapest ever</strong> shows a game's lowest price ever and when that price occurred. <strong>Price notifications</strong> lets you set a price point and receive an alert when the game drops below it at any of the tracked retailers.</p><p>CheapShark's deals listing page has an interesting sorting measure called <strong>Deal Rating</strong>. It considers various factors (e.g., absolute price, percent off, Metascore, release date) to determine how good the deal is. Very nifty at a glance!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=humble-bundle>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/humble-bundle.jpg><p>The Humble Bundle started in 2010 as a discounted collection of video games with some proceeds donated to charity. Its first few bundles consisted of mainly indie games, but it has since evolved to include AAA titles and other more desirable games.</p><p>Humble Bundles are known for the "pay what you want" approach, which means you can grab lots of games for very cheap. However, in every Bundle, some of the most desirable titles are only available if you spend a minimum amount.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can also browse <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Humble Store</a> for regular sales. Either way, these two options comprise some of the best ways to save money and get cheap games.</p><h2 id=fanatical>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fanatical</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fanatical.jpg><p>Fanatical is an online game store that always has deep discounts on the latest and greatest games. While the prices on Fanatical are usually great anyway, the site often holds sales or flash deals where you can get even cheaper prices than usual. Since <a href=#>video gaming is an expensive hobby</a>, these bargains are much welcome.</p><p>You should also check out Fanatical's bundles, where it packages similar games together for a discount rate. Occasionally, you can build your own bundle to get a group discount on a bulk purchase.</p><h2 id=slickdeals>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slickdeals</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/slickdeals.jpg><p>Slickdeals is one of the best sites for daily deals, period, let alone as a destination for where to buy cheap games. Users post deals whenever they spot them around the web, receive them in emails, and so on. And since deals are available across many other departments (e.g., home, tech, travel), Slickdeals is a great choice if you want an all-in-one deals site.</p><p>After using Slickdeals for a while, you'll see why it's one of <a href=#>the best bargain sites cheaper than eBay</a>. Lots of people use it, which means any deal is likely to pop up there.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=gg-deals>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GG.deals</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/gg-deals.jpg><p>GG.deals is a PC game price comparison website that ensures you're getting the best deal. It compares prices across official stores and key shops, taking into consideration any active promo codes. It also lets you know whether the game is included as part of any subscription service, like Ubisoft+ or Game Pass.</p><p>Not only that, but GG.deals tracks the historical price of a game so that you can ensure you're genuinely getting a good deal. In fact, sometimes you might not have to spend a dime, since the site also notifies you when a service is giving a game away free.</p><h2 id=reddit-39-s-r-gamedeals-and-r-consoledeals>7.

While /r/GameDeals is technically for all game deals, it does have a heavy slant towards PC gamers. That's why /r/ConsoleDeals was born.</p><p>While PC games are usually cheaper than console games, the beauty is that you can play whichever you want and still benefit from the deals subreddit that applies to you. These deals aggregators are two of the best you'll find.</p><p>And while you're on Reddit, you may as well check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">/r/patientgamers</a>. It's a community of gamers who wait at least six months after a game is released before buying it, which often results in super savings thanks to things like Black Friday sales.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=green-man-gaming>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Man Gaming</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/green-man-gaming.jpg><p>Green Man Gaming is one of the best stores and game discount sites. If you want cheap video games, Green Man Gaming has you sorted. It sells Steam and Xbox keys, but you can buy in the knowledge and safety that every key has come direct from the publisher—no shady third-party benefits here.</p><p>As you buy on Green Man Gaming, you earn XP. Of course, the more you buy, the more XP you earn, and you can redeem this on future purchases to get even greater discounts. It applies the discount automatically, so you're always getting the best deal.</p><h2 id=gocdkeys>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gocdkeys</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gocdkeys.jpg><p>Gocdkeys compares the cost of keys for games on multiple platforms. It scans small and big retailers, and lets you filter by things like supported payment system or region availability.</p><p>The site also displays reviews for all of its retailers, so you can compare price and trustworthiness side by side. As such, you can be confident knowing that you're getting a great deal on the game you want to buy.</p><p>Be careful to only buy from legit and safe key sites. To help you stay safe, here's <a href=#>what to know before buying discounted game keys</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=dlcompare>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DLCompare</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dlcompare.jpg><p>You might be willing to play a game on multiple platforms, especially if you own a gaming PC and a console. If so, DLCompare is the site for you because it compares a game's price across all the platforms. It's one of the best sites to source cheap games from.</p><p>This means that you can easily see whether it would be cheaper to buy the game on PS5 rather than Xbox Series X, for example. Of course, you can also filter if needs be, either by platform, store, or type of game (like "standard edition" or "season pass").</p><h2 id=how-to-decide-what-game-to-buy>How to Decide What Game to Buy</h2><p>These sites are sure to net you a great bargain on the next game that you want to play.
