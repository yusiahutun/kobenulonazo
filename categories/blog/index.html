The perception is that back then it was more glamorous – passengers actually dressed up for flights, now they wear tracksuits and pyjamas – more exciting and more exclusive.
But a former airline captain, Ian Frow, whose career began in 1958 with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), offered a different take on this view. He recorded his memories of the era for posterity on a blog post for&nbsp;pilots’ union Balpa, revealing&nbsp;that the flying experience in the 50s and 60s had plenty of downsides – ‘to remember those early days as a vintage travel brochure come to life would be incorrect’.</p><footer><a href=../../were-50s-60s-really-golden-age-air-travel-ex-pilot-revealed-werent-html.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../giancarlo-esposito.html>Who is Giancarlo Esposito dating?

Smoking kills.
Tobacco remains the single leading preventable cause of illness and death in the UK. Up to 2 in 3 lifelong smokers will die from their habit.
Smoking is also the biggest cause of cancer. For every five cancer deaths in England, one is linked to smoking.

Such designs traditionally feature twinned white diamonds, but have also been set throughout history with coloured gemstones of varying cuts and colours.</p><footer><a href=../../toi-et-moi-engagement-rings-really-say-forever-napoleon-and-josephine-john-and-jackie-kennedy-and.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../anne-frank-facts.html>Best 20 Anne Frank Facts - Life, Family, Memoir &amp;amp; More</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
