The actress revealed the news through an IG post on Jan 24, where Kiley and Matthew looked so in love as they held their newborn.</span></p><p><span>So, meanwhile, Kiley takes a break from her busy life in this post-maternity period, let us also spare some time to learn more about the star; especially her age, job, scar, and family over this Kiley Casciano Bio.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Kiley Casciano, Matthew Davis Wife</b></h3><p><span>Kiley Casciano and Matthew Davis tied the knot on December 23, 2018. But unlike the usual preplanned ceremony, it was an impromptu one.</span></p><p><span>Yes, the evening the duo got married, they were shopping in the produce section of Erewhon. It was also where Matthew asked Kiley if she wanted to get married or let’s say that was where the informal engagement took place.</span></p><p><span>3 hours later the “informal engagement,” the couple was husband-wife.</span></p><p><span>To recall the ceremony, Kiley was wearing an above-the-knee sleeveless white dress from Enze Apparel and shiny sandals, while Matthew rocked that off-white shirt and dark pants — and colorful Bill Murray socks.</span></p><p><span>As for the rings they exchanged, it included a rainbow moonstone for Kiley, which came from the jewelry brand </span><i><span>Made in Earth</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>For the venue, the lovebirds chose the Albertson Wedding Chapel in Los Angeles. “This is where we got married … in a strip mall,”&nbsp; Kiley even took it to her IG to surprise her fans.</span></p><p><span>You can imagine how much rush there is to conduct even a preplanned wedding and to go for an impromptu one, Kiley and Matthew should be commended. But seems like they weren’t alone that day. “Thanks to Abbot Kinney for the last-minute provisions,” Matthew wrote over IG.</span></p><p><span>Overall, the wedding looked amazing as seen from the pictures. It had floral arrangements, rings, cakes, and everything.</span></p><p><span>Following the nuptials, the duo made their way to a beach vacation for their honeymoon.</span></p><p><span>A little over a year later, Kiley and Matthew then welcomed their first baby named Ripley Nightingale Davis on March 31, 2020. The proud dad took it to his Twitter to share the good news, also mentioning that the baby took after her dad with blonde hair and blue eyes, but she had “mom’s beautiful face.”</span></p><p><span>The next year, the duo then dropped another bomb revealing that they were pregnant with another child in August 2021.
