<time>25 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Whether you're looking for somewhere to host your digital art portfolio or simply want to share your latest artworks, it can be difficult to choose a website to upload to. Or at least, it definitely is more so than before, now that art websites aren't bubbling with as much excitement as they used to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You know that each site has its pros and cons, but it's hard to figure out what those are unless you make an account and see for yourself. Don't worry if you don't have time for that—we've got your back. Here are the websites we recommend for sharing your digital art, and why you might want to consider them.</p><h2 id=pixiv>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixiv</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pixiv-1.jpg><p>If you were around when the online art scene was ridiculously active, chances are that your art style is influenced by anime and/or manga in some way. Otaku culture began its slow sneak into mainstream media back then, and Pixiv is a great home for artists that fall in that category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pixiv started as a small online community based in Japan, but has since grown into a site with over 50 million artists from all around the world. It's often praised for having "better" art overall when compared to other art-sharing platforms. This could perhaps be attributed to the fact that most professional Japanese illustrators choose Pixiv as their portfolio site.</p><p>The site used to be infamous for its messy navigation and gallery setup. Netizens found humor in knowing that the site was still gaining traction even when it was a headache to use. Since then, most of Pixiv's old overcrowded design has been replaced with a sleeker interface, so there isn't much to complain about now.</p><h2 id=artstation>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtStation</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/artstation-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>ArtStation's rise to prominence comes in perfect timing with the growth of the video game industry. That's because the site is mainly geared towards creatives interested in video games and film animation (though it welcomes artists of all kinds). It's not uncommon for big-name companies in those industries to search for new recruits on ArtStation.</p><p>That said, ArtStation is definitely more of a platform than it is a community. You're much more likely to form business connections than you are to form ride-or-die online friendships. That's a dealbreaker for a lot of artists, especially if you're one to rely on feedback. But you can't deny that ArtStation usually has content to deliver whenever there's a new art trend going around.</p><h2 id=deviantart>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeviantArt</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/deviant-art-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DeviantArt is very much a platform you'd call "old faithful." Digital artists that have been on the scene for over five years have probably been on DeviantArt at one point or another. It's got everything you'd need: a place to display your works, a vast potential audience, commission features, and social spaces.</p><p>Having been around since 2000, DeviantArt is the launch point for many of today's biggest independent illustrators, such as Yue Wang (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sakimichan</a>), Wenqing Yan (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">yuumei</a>), and Lois Van Baarle (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loish</a>). Unfortunately, the site probably doesn't have the power to propel new artists to those heights anymore.</p><p>The site still has a huge userbase, yet there isn't as much engagement as there once was. Most deviants these days seem to be the silent lurking type, which is why DeviantArt is no longer considered to be "the" platform to share art. It remains plenty useful, but it's in desperate need of an upgrade—one that consists of more than just a rebrand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=artfol>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Artfol</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/artfol-discover.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/artfol-portraits.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/artfol.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p><a href=#>Artfol officially launched in April 2021</a>, which makes it the youngest platform on this list. Artfol had the privilege of getting to see where the platforms before it failed and was developed with the help of a lot of user feedback, so it gets right what a lot of other "aspiring-to-be-the-new-standard" platforms get wrong.</p><p>DeviantArt and ArtStation have received criticism in the past for featuring the same artists on their front pages, which is probably why Artfol has decided to ditch "complex algorithms" altogether. It promises that all its users have equal opportunity to be seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Artfol also keeps personal metrics private (only you can see your Like counts), and offers fun in-app Challenges. Unfortunately, many of the features are limited to a mobile app as the web version is in beta at the time of writing.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Artfol for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=behance>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Behance</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/behance-1.jpg><p>Behance is to art-sharing websites what LinkedIn is to social media networks. It's less suited for hobbyists and is built for those willing to pursue digital art as a profession. There's a Discover feed you can sift through, and even dedicated spaces for job hunting and live streams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scrolling through the website can seem intimidating at first, as Behance has no shortage of talented individuals. But that also means it's a really good place to receive constructive criticism—which is the best part about it. When the artists aren't fighting for the same job opportunities, they're helping each other improve.</p><p>The platform is owned by none other than the big creative tech conglomerate that is Adobe. Thankfully, that doesn't mean that you need a Creative Cloud subscription to use Behance. You will need to create an Adobe ID, though.</p><h2 id=instagram>6. Instagram</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instagram-artoftheday.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instagram-digitalart.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instagram-profile.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Instagram is a hesitant entry on this list. It undoubtedly can get your name and art out there if you know <a href=#>how to maximize your Instagram exposure</a>, but such a feat is much harder than it would be on any other platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why? Well, Instagram welcomes images and videos of a variety of things. There are artists, of course, but there are also a bunch of photos of folks' everyday lives. It's like if you were a traditional painter, and you chose to hang your piece in the middle of a shopping mall instead of a museum. The consumers are there for reasons other than appreciating art.</p><p>Still, hashtags on Instagram are more powerful than some people expect. #artistsoninstagram and #artoftheday, for instance, are great tags to use when you're not sure if you want to tag a specific theme, tool, or technique.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Instagram for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=doodle-addicts>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doodle Addicts</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/doodle-addicts-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doodle Addicts is a fairly new online art community, but it doesn't lack when it comes to its features. Of course, you can use Doodle Addicts to discover art and to upload and share your own to the community of over 30,000 members, but that's not all.</p><p>Doodle Addicts offers fun drawing challenges, art prompts, art discussions and conversions, and an online marketplace. Struggling with creative block? This is where Doodle drawing challenges and drawing prompts come in handy. Try using them together with these <a href=#>awesome free online drawing and painting tools</a>.</p><p>The drawing prompts are emailed straight to you every Monday, however, keep in mind that you need to upgrade to Doodle Addicts Plus to receive them.</p><h2 id=dribbble>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dribbble</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dribbble-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Dribbble platform is slightly more popular among creatives and designers who are searching for job opportunities. It is also a well-known <a href=#>online community for graphic designers</a>.</p><p>However, it is still an excellent online platform if all you want to do is simply share and showcase your work. From animations and illustrations to web design and typography, you'll also be admiring other digital designers' work.</p><p>If you find something you like, show some love by sharing it with your social networks, saving it to your collections, or leaving some feedback. After all, if you're using Dribbble to get hired for your digital art, constructive criticism is always helpful.</p><h2 id=share-your-digital-art-with-the-world>Share Your Digital Art With the World</h2><p>When choosing an art website, there's a lot to consider.
