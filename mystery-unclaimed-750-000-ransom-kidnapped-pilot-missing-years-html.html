Lindsey went on the run.</span></p><p><span>In desperation, FBI agents obtained detailed call records of the location of Robert's mobile phone calls and, in turn, CCTV footage of the various toll booths on the Polk Parkway where a call was made from.</span></p><p><span>Tom was drafted in to look at the tapes and quickly spotted the car of Toby Holt, his 42-year-old operations manager, who passed through the toll booth with his right arm and hand close to his ear.</span></p><p><span>But, according to Holt's own phone records, his mobile was not in use as he went through the toll. He then became a prime suspect, was called in for questioning and could not provide an alibi for his whereabouts that evening.</span></p><p><span>The FBI discovered he had several mistresses, outside his marriage to wife Beverly. But there was no DNA, blood or forensic proof to link him to the crime. The trail had gone cold. Then, in March 2009, the FBI called in reinforcements to 'systematically' go back over the case.</span></p><p><span>They soon realised that 'Toby Holt's phone and Robert Wiles' phones were seemingly synchronised' meaning that, in the tollbooth photograph, Holt was using Wiles' phone.</span></p><p><span>Bucenell said: 'When you put them together - the pieces of the puzzle - it's - it's a very strong circumstantial case.' Holt was arrested on December 18, 2009, at Orlando International Airport after a flight from Bogota, Colombia.</span></p><p><span>Toby Holt, whose real first name is Stobert, denied the charges of extortion, kidnapping and murder of Robert Wiles and languished in a Florida jail for two years.</span></p><p><span>Then, in January 2012, he stood trial. Defence lawyers said there was no evidence and pointed the finger at Steve Lindsey, who in fact died of lung cancer in 2009.</span></p><p><span>But prosecutors said that 'too many coincidences is not a coincidence' and that Holt's unexplained whereabouts for over four hours the night Robert disappeared was key. They also said Holt repeatedly used Wiles' phone, even using it to send the ransom demand to his father.</span></p><p><span>Holt was found guilty of manslaughter and is currently scheduled for release in 2039 when he will be 72-years-old. He is appealing his conviction based on insufficient evidence.</span></p><p><span>Tom Wiles told the court following the verdict: 'Keep this man off the street, and maybe someway, somehow, somewhere he'll decide to tell us where, what he did - what he did with Robert.</span></p><p><span>'We have a son. We don't know where he is. We wanna bring him home. I wanna know where my son is.' Pamela added: 'I'd give anything for - to hear him again. Just to touch him again.'</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FcoCTamlwZ32uwLWx0bJkrqaToa6qucSdZHBtYGJ9cXyMq5inq5%2Bieqy1w6eYqaiVmXqxtcuoq2almajAqrrGZrCemaKoe6nAzKU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmystery-unclaimed-750-000-ransom-kidnapped-pilot-missing-years-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmystery-unclaimed-750-000-ransom-kidnapped-pilot-missing-years-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmystery-unclaimed-750-000-ransom-kidnapped-pilot-missing-years-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmystery-unclaimed-750-000-ransom-kidnapped-pilot-missing-years-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmystery-unclaimed-750-000-ransom-kidnapped-pilot-missing-years-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmystery-unclaimed-750-000-ransom-kidnapped-pilot-missing-years-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-power-of-vulnerability.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-power-of-vulnerability.html>The Power of Vulnerability</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jenna-coleman-style-evolution.html>Jenna Coleman's Style Evolution</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jenna-coleman-style-evolution.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
