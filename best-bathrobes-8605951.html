After a long day, don’t we all just want to come home and be enveloped by something that feels totally cozy? The best robes offer this extreme comfort factor and more. Whether <strong>a plush and warm option</strong> is on your mind, or something <strong>lightweight that will transcend the seasons</strong> is more your speed, finding the right robe has never been easier. We asked the hard questions and<strong> put dozens (38) to the test</strong> to find the best robes in every category and material imaginable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We asked our real-world testers to <strong>assess the robes’ quality by describing their softness, comfort, and durability </strong>after wearing and washing them regularly over the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>testing period</a>. Was the material heavy or lightweight? Was it easy to overheat, or was it not warm enough? In terms of function, did the robe stay tied when on, or did it have any features like pockets or a hood that seemed particularly useful? <strong>22 robes</strong> made the cut for this roundup, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>warm flannels</a> for the coldest of winter days, terry cloth alternatives to keep you dry post-shower, and short, silky styles to satisfy any fashion lover's itch for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>something luxurious</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-parachute-waffle-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Parachute Waffle Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Parachute Waffle Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PaaIdIAFuEtr68IcLavbf55SMXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/parachute-waffle-robe-6c79728930d04f718cf576f811de787e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Parachute</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The Turkish cotton material is Oeko-Tex certified, making it a sustainably made option.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some customers found it tore or snagged easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Parachute’s Short Waffle robe is a year-round option that feels like you’re throwing on your favorite cardigan. Made from soft, Turkish cotton, the textured waffle knit is a signature for high-end spa robes — however, you don’t have to go anywhere to indulge in the luxurious nature of this option. This waffle robe can be worn over and over, in the comfort of your own home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The material is extremely lightweight and made from cotton, which is notoriously breathable, so overheating is never a concern. The wider, bell sleeves are loose and oversized, as is the overall silhouette in general, adding the extra ability to be layered with ease — if you’d like to wear pajamas underneath and more. Hitting just above the knee, the fit is not too short or too long — it simply rests in the middle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although there was no internal extra tie, we found that the sash stayed firmly tied and never unraveled. The two side pockets are deep enough to stash a cell phone and more, should you be wearing the garment around the house doing chores, or sneaking out to a backyard hot tub during the colder months for a warm plunge. A towel hook makes hanging it up post-use a breeze, and it’s a machine-washable item that is very low maintenance. Classic, comfortable, and lightweight — what more can you ask for?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Turkish cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-runner-up-cuyana-washable-charmeuse-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall, Runner-Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuyana Washable Charmeuse Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuyana Washable Charmeuse Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7q-IGqnQpKyWnJNtErXz2SgOhr8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cuyana-Washable-Charmeuse-Robe-ce4f8a2f36fa4e01b6779834305d5a80.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cuyana</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Although made from a silk fabric, it doesn’t require dry cleaning.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brand tends to run large, rather than true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cuyana’s Washable Charmeuse Robe brings the luxury of silk to a simple robe design, without the unnecessary headache of a “dry clean only” tag. When a garment is meant to be worn over and over, silk usually becomes too bothersome, due to its restrictive care instructions. Thankfully, Cuyana found a silky charmeuse that is as easy to wear often as it is to clean regularly when necessary.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The soft, breathable fabric won’t cause irritation either, for those with sensitive skin. The lightweight nature of the silk fabric makes it pleasant to wear during spring, summer, and fall seasons (but an alternative option might be needed during the winter for those looking for extra warmth in colder climates). The relaxed silhouette also adds an airy quality to the overall experience that gives it a breezy, not-too-clingy feel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the factors that we love, when it comes to this wrap design, is that the ties stayed securely snug during testing. Often with silkier style robes, there is a tendency for the sash to loosen and fall, but this one stayed firmly tied. There is also an additional internal tie for extra security, giving it more of a defined waistline look. Elegant and functional, this is a winner in our book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Charmeuse silk | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ikea-rockn-bathrobe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>IKEA ROCKÅN Bathrobe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="IKEA ROCK&amp;Atilde;N Bathrobe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xVz_Gst3MXifhL2W5B3OQ5gNOG4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rockan-bathrobe-white__1135537_pe879096_s5-fd6a80c2255e4f5db6646d4c42907bd0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>IKEA</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The great quality for an affordable price.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Cleaning with a fabric softener is not recommended.

Perhaps this robe is not what you’re going to be lying around all day in, binge-watching your latest series obsession, but it's the perfect, post-shower option for getting ready and more. This cotton, terry cloth fabrication is cut in a unisex fit and as traditional as they come, but with no exorbitant markup. Priced at just $30, it’s a real steal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand didn’t skimp on design details either. The sleeve’s seam is sewn diagonally away from the armpit — meaning no chafing against the skin and more room to move. An adjustable belt loop allows you to tie the bathrobe at the natural waist or below the stomach. The pockets have been placed on the side rather than the front, so if you’re planning on carrying things in them, they are not uncomfortably hanging over the stomach area when tied up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Purchasing one for yourself is a no-brainer, but it also makes a great gift idea or a fabulous guest room addition to have on hand for any upcoming visitors. Anyone will truly appreciate the simplicity of this functional and practical robe option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>S/M–L/XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-terry-cloth-avocado-organic-french-terry-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Terry Cloth</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Avocado Organic French Terry Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Avocado Organic French Terry Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UdAWjqz3DxfSAVJCaNn2EIOTCok=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Avocado-Organic-French-Terry-Robe-a1d2fc7413fb4d058de8de015305ddd4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Avocado</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ultra-plush, spa-quality<strong> </strong>feeling.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brand runs small, rather than true to size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Avocado’s Organic French Terry Robe is what robe dreams are made of. Soft, cozy, and plush, it’s made from GOTS-certified organic cotton, ethically sourced from India. The brand as a whole has countless sustainable attributes and processes, making it well worth the investment. Whether you are slipping into this robe after a long <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bath</a> or wearing it around the house over pajamas, it’s a snuggly option for all-season wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cotton fabrication is thick enough to dry you off after the shower, without being too heavy or bulky (as sometimes the thicker qualities of terry can feel). We love that there is no lint or fuzz residue after wearing wet and no itchiness or discomforting feeling either. Sometimes terry cloth starts to feel a bit scratchy after wears and washes and this feeling was not present at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hitting mid-calf, this one has a bit of length for a little extra coverage, but we recommend customers who are taller to size up. Bonus points: deep, front pockets make carrying anything around the house all the easier. For the quality we experienced, this robe is well worth the $109 price tag and we are certain it will withstand wear for years to come.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fuzzy-barefoot-dreams-cozychic-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fuzzy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EvBkbt8SEaxdlrDo8k34bGxqoP0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/barefoot-dreams-cozychic-robe-e30fd2d960444c41ace6b2a133461ded.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Barefoot Dreams</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's extremely warm and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It runs large and on the longer side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you are craving the feeling of being wrapped in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blanket</a>, Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Unisex Robe is the answer. Made from a cozy, soft, fuzzy material, it may just be the most comfortable robe you’ve ever worn. Featuring a slightly stretchy quality, it’s surprisingly bouncy. Regardless of the textured nature of the fabric, this one still feels lightweight and doesn’t bulk while on. Since this is a thicker, warmer material, we recommend wearing it during the colder months (or in an air-conditioned room).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Traditional in fit, it has a wrap front that ties around the waist and two spacious front pockets. Since this is a unisex style, petites should note that it does run on the longer side. In terms of wear, we found that there was no shedding or excess lint after washing it, just be sure to follow the care instructions to keep it from losing its fluffy volume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester microfiber<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>1–3 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-waffle-amazon-essentials-womens-lightweight-waffle-full-length-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Waffle</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Essentials Waffle Full-Length Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Essentials Women's Lightweight Waffle Full-Length Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vlfsJOKaWaQk5nLWpQN_6lEDSHs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-essentials-womens-lightweight-waffle-full-length-robe-134357e89d614e63863ae7f5bfd63b7a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's lightweight and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Customers noted some shrinking occurred during the wash process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking for a no-frills option that won’t break the bank, Amazon Essentials’ Women’s Lightweight Waffle Full-Length Robe was a favorite on our list. The classic, waffle knit design comes in 15 colorways and 13 sizes extending from XS to 7X, so there is something for everyone. It provides coverage and function with a soft touch and easy feel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lightweight and airy, the fabric is composed of a cotton and polyester blend that is extremely wearable without irritation. The gauzy consistency in a relaxed silhouette can be worn all year in many climates since it's both breathable and absorbent. The simple waistband sash is easy to tie, making it effortless to move around without difficulty or restrictions. Two deep and wide pockets can be found on either side of the front of the robe, giving extra storage for keys, phone, and more while you are going from room to room at home, drying your hair, or brushing your teeth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found the quality to be better than expected for the low price point.

The Super-Plush style is inspired by the brand’s beloved Super-Plush bath towels, made for everyday luxury in a comfortable, Turkish cotton fabric. It feels like you’re being embraced in a warm hug, without extra bulk or unnecessary weight, that might cause you to overheat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bridging the gap between various weights, this robe is not too heavy and not too light, and the fabric has no stretch. Running pretty true to size, the longer sleeves feature adjustable cuffs, so you can roll them up if needed — to apply moisturizer or makeup, for instance. There is no hood feature on this style, but there are two pockets that rest on the sides of the garment for those small, extra yet functional design details.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Super-Plush makes for a great option, be it for around the house or lounging since the comfortable, soft material feels nicer to the touch than many no-brand options. This robe has also received the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 Certification, ensuring that the garment has passed safety tests for the presence of harmful substances, which checks another mark off our list. Since a robe is something you will wear often and so close to the skin, you want to look for this high-level standard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Turkish cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-drying-coyuchi-unisex-organic-waffle-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Drying</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coyuchi Organic Waffle Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coyuchi Unisex Organic Waffle Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hHKMsBnp9kBAHtv4v07ZpUbHwp4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Coyuchi-Organic-Waffle-Robe--a70e65f3bcc44f129142fbaa1136f96d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It stays crisp and bright after washing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Customers found the garment shrank in the dryer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most absorbent robe on our list has to be the Coyuchi Unisex Organic Waffle Robe. Although the fabric is made from a lightweight, GOTS-certified cotton, the classic waffle knit design surprisingly seeps up moisture and dries impressively fast when worn right out of the shower, something that is generally unheard of. If towel drying is not your thing, then this is the robe for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand advertises that the fabric just gets better with each wash and wear, and we have to agree. Pre-tumbled, we found that the robe starts to get even softer after washing, without pills or stretching out. Suitable for all-year-round wear, the cotton fabrication ensures that you won’t overheat in this robe either, whether in the heat of a 95-degree climate or a colder air-conditioned environment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another benefit is the roomy, looser silhouette. Cut with a relaxed, easy-to-wear fit, the longer hemline also passes the “pretzel sit” test (essentially meaning that it still keeps your legs covered if you are sitting cross-legged or with folded legs). Although it doesn’t offer stretch, the design allows for movement without feeling too oversized or disproportionate. Spacious pockets and a double belt loop with sash complete the design features.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS/S–XXL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 8</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-cuyana-organic-pima-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuyana Organic Pima Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuyana Organic Pima Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dyan18Lkq3LKbXVTpAr8J6pwVXU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cuyana-organic-pima-robe-d80a7dfc41ae44e0ac8e6e8c73984c30.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cuyana</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The Pima cotton jersey fabrication is very lightweight.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Customers note colors are not exactly how they appear in the photos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Airy, lightweight, and soft. Another one of our favorite robes happens to be from Cuyana, as well. This one, however, is made from organic Pima cotton that is grown, spun, and finished in Peru. The jersey fabric is known for breathability and comfort, having a smooth and silky feel, while remaining very flexible. It’s also eco-friendly — having been certified by Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Oeko-Tex, and Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the best results, we recommend drying yourself before putting this robe on, since it doesn’t have the same absorbance as a terry cloth fabrication. Still, we found that water didn’t seep through with, say, wet hair from the shower. The fabric is also able to be machine-washed with a delicate cycle, making for easy cleaning — and there was no shedding with wear or wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The shorter length silhouette fits standard and true to size, and although it only has one belt-tie closure, it stays tied if done properly. Overall, this roomy fit is well-made and sturdy, so you don’t feel constricted, while being a comfortable weight for most temperatures, including spring, summer, and fall months. It’s an everyday option that you can (and most likely will) reach for over and over and will retain its original feel and shape, even with wash and wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic pima cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–L/XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plush-four-seasons-spa-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Four Seasons Spa Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Four Seasons Spa Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/C-SAQP9H912p2TbA21bLyDGCtB8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Four-Seasons-Spa-Robe-c5f1d5a3589b4a7ab38e59cca57883fa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Four Seasons</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It feels like you’re staying at a five-star luxury hotel.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Due to the plush fabrication, it can get extremely warm while wearing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If a high-end, luxury hotel bathroom is your idea of heaven (it’s certainly high on our list), you will be pleasantly surprised to find that you can buy the Four Seasons’ Spa Bathrobe to enjoy at home. Whether you have stayed at one of the brand’s many amazing properties before and want to keep it as a memento, or you’re simply hoping to channel your wanderlust while rewatching episodes of “The White Lotus” (whose breathtaking hotels are all filmed at a Four Seasons resort), this is one cozy robe that is worth indulging in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this robe unique is the combination fabrication — featuring a microsuede exterior with a microfiber terry interior — and then embroidered with the iconic logo on the chest. The material on the inside feels like you’re being hugged by a cloud, while the outside shell is a luxuriously soft cotton-like material that doesn’t wrinkle. We put this to the test with a lot of wear and wash, and it still looked brand new afterward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A traditional fit with longer sleeves and a longer hemline gives it an even more luxurious feel. We recommend sizing up to give you that oversized, even roomier fit that feels like five-star quality hospitality. Just be sure to wear it in cooler climates or seasons, since it is quite warm due to the extremely plush, double-layer materials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Microsuede exterior, microfibre terry interior<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>M–XXXL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spa-kashwere-signature-shawl-collar-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Spa</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kashwere Signature Shawl Collar Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kashwere Signature Shawl Collar Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/46X2GLigufCWBKQgpvpoiSUWSuA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kashwere-Signature-Shawl-Collar-Robe-57d53031b1a245bf9c1ecec6f5ba59fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kashwere</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It feels like cashmere without needing to be dry cleaned.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It could be too warm for the summer or hotter climates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kashwére’s signature Chanilla fabric is a plush material that is one of the softest we have experienced. It feels like a warm, cashmere blanket with sleeves, without the fussy cleaning processes. Inspired by the pampering at luxury hotels, the Signature Shawl Collar robe is a high-quality option that can be worn out of the shower while lounging in the house, and more. We found the fabric to be wrinkle and lint-free, without pilling or stretching out with wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The unisex-sized robe falls to ankle length on a 5-foot, 6-inch tall body and is a good option for taller customers, if this has been a problem for you in the past. The fit is proportionate, even the armpits and arm lengths feel tailored enough for someone who is not petite. The classic, double-loop belt closes with a self-tie in front, and two deep pockets allow for stashing of whatever accessories you might want to be carrying around. The shawl collar sits comfortably around the neck, without any irritation, either. Due to the plush, fuzzy nature of the garment, we do recommend this one for cooler temperatures or milder days. The warmth properties of the fabric may cause overheating or sweating in higher temperatures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-kimono-short-kimono-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KIM+ONO Short Kimono Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="KIM+ONO Short Kimono Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FcTZV_pNrNn8nJzL1BMZy7oEPQQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kim-ono-peony--butterfly-short-kimono-robe-ddf5e414e38744f1acc4cb71e0ec456c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>KIM+ONO</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The romantic print.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no pockets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">KIM+ONO’s Peony & Butterfly Short Kimono Robe is a thinner robe option. Since this robe is made from a slinky, polyester charmeuse blend that is comparable to silk, it’s not a finicky fabric that you have to take a lot of care with. You can throw it in the washer and dryer quite easily, without worry. The kimono wrap shape is typical for the material, tying simply with a sash and belt loops — however, there are internal ties included for extra coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The romantic floral and fauna print has a vintage, boudoir feel that will add a little bit of glamor to your everyday routines. It also is versatile enough to be worn outside the home, over street clothes and such, as another styling layer. When paired with a crisp, white t-shirt, perfectly worn-in denim, ballet flats or suede boots, and layered jewelry, it makes for a Bohemian-inspired look that still feels relevant today.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only advice would be to not choose this robe if you are looking for something super warm and plush, since it clearly will not serve that purpose. Nevertheless, if you’re in the mood for an everyday option that brings a little luxury to the ordinary, then it’s a great pick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>OS<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flannel-llbean-mens-scotch-plaid-flannel-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flannel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.L.Bean Scotch Plaid Flannel Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L.L.Bean Men's Scotch Plaid Flannel Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nLeu5FyomPSGCCrAfYWkRCxFfEk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/llbean-mens-scotch-plaid-flannel-robe-a38232e887cd429c8e765cfbe04296a3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>L.L.Bean</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Monogramming is available to make it a bit more personal.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some customers were disappointed that this was not a super thick flannel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s more iconic than L.L.Bean’s fisherman knits and Bean boots? Their super soft, cotton flannels. A signature of the Maine-based heritage brand, there is a secret to why L.L.Bean’s is truly the best. The fabric is woven with long staple cotton, rather than most flannels that are woven from shorter fibers. It also is brushed eight times on each side, to create even more softness and warmth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made using these high-quality, traditional techniques means that quality is never a concern when it comes to the final product. This robe is built to last. It’s not excessively heavy either, so it will work for a variety of climates and temperatures (although perhaps not best for hot, summer months). Of course, the six plaid prints give us cozy, fall and winter New England vibes, but this flannel is a bit more lightweight, so the robe is adaptable for any time of year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to silhouette, L.L.Bean stuck with the classic design details. A shawl collar that wraps over the front is tied with a matching belt, which we found to be a great length, allowing you to tie wherever you feel with plenty of extra fabric. The other detail that sets this apart is the bonus chest pocket in addition to the two, standard front pockets (placed near the stomach area). Overall, it will be a favorite for years to come.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton flannel<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>S–XXL Regular; M–XXXL Tall<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-hood-llbean-womens-wicked-plush-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Hood</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.L.Bean Wicked Plush Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L.L.Bean Women's Wicked Plush Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/De4XYNgXuMmWi0JZ0ZmIRVIQYOE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/L.L.Bean-Womens-Wicked-Plush-Robe-c7259f3237ee4b7cb9c7b95f1f8aa825.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>L.L.Bean</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The cozy, plush material will keep you warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It takes a long time to dry on tumble.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are looking for something to snuggle up in, this is the robe for you. Wearing L.L.Bean’s Wicked Plush Robe feels like wearing a cozy fleece or microfiber blanket. After all, it was inspired by the brand’s customer-favorite throw blanket, and the feeling holds up in garment form. The best part? It has a hood for an even more huggable feeling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether wearing it to sip hot cocoa in front of the fireplace or thrown on over pajamas for a quick run outside to let the dog out, this robe is sure to keep you warm and comfortable. Front patch pockets, a removable belt, and an inside tie round out the standard design details, while sherpa lines the hood and cuff, for an even cozier effect. We love the vast run of sizes that this one comes in as well — ranging from regular, petite, and plus-size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A few things to remember. This robe ran true to size (and even slightly on the smaller side), so size up if you are looking for a more generous fit. And since the fleece-like material is not highly absorbent, we found that it was best not to wear it immediately after showering. Be sure to dry off before wearing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL Regular and Petite; 1X–3X Plus<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-lunya-washable-silk-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lunya Washable Silk Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lunya Washable Silk Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dnueV4dsfsqZcHcfVw5iyBcap8Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lunya-Washable-Silk-Robe-a317d885eaa04410b5141f0ded70daab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Built-in thermoregulating properties help maintain a comfortable body temperature.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The style does not extend above a 1X size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good, washable silk robe can be hard to come by.

This one’s made from delicate, mulberry silk that can be hand or machine-washed on a cold temperature cycle, without destroying the quality of the fabric.

Side pockets are included as part of the simple design features, as are inside ties for added security, and a thin, self-tie belt. The most thoughtful detail happens to be the elastic cuffs that finish the sleeve.

It’s a unisex style that is made from soft polyester but doesn’t feel synthetic.

Cinched wrist cuffs will allow you to roll up the sleeves with ease, while you’re applying an extensive skincare regime or doing your makeup before a night out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Play up the cozy vibes and layer over your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite pajamas</a>, slip nightgown, or alone, as it won’t rub or irritate bare skin either.

Featuring long sleeves and a long hemline, it’s warm, soft, and ultra-comforting. Thanks to its loose structure, the robe forms according to your body. Whether worn post or pre-shower, for an evening of Netflix binging, or a lazy day around the house, the poly-plush is stretchy and flexible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabric is also extremely durable. We found that there was no shedding while in use, and even after the first wash, there was no discoloration either. It retained the original, fluffy exterior, just as when it arrived brand new and didn’t stretch or pill with wear. Another bonus was zero wrinkling — which is a huge plus when sitting, standing, and laying make up the bulk of the activities that a robe is used for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The roomier cut is a unisex fit, draping straight to the floor. Overall, the body shape has an oversized feel, so if you prefer a bit of room, this is the perfect fit for you. Large pockets are another favorite call-out on this style, and we love that the robe is monogrammable — making for a great personalized item for yourself or gifting to a loved one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Poly-plush<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-lounging-skims-soft-lounge-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Lounging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Soft Lounge Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Soft Lounge Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/l599z48Sr_DNObSeHeqPV34gYiU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Skims-Soft-Lounge-Robe-128488c9132d4e6e8c35958589802e9c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in a diverse size range from XXS to 4X.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The longer sleeves can’t be rolled up due to the slippery texture of the fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skims has become the fashion destination for intimates, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>loungewear</a>, and the best basics, so it’s only natural that their Soft Lounge Robe be on our list of favorites. The modal-spandex blend has a ribbed texture throughout, which sets it apart from the others we tested. Modal is notoriously soft, and this robe is certainly that. The fabric also has an excellent, loose drape, and that touch of spandex adds the tiniest amount of stretch to the overall feel. Although this lounge robe is not by any means as heavy as a plush or sherpa material, the fabric does have a little weight to it, so it can be worn during every season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This buttery texture is great for relaxing, but we don’t recommend wearing it without drying off first. The quality of the bathrobe stayed consistent with its original form, after lots of wear and washes, but it does not absorb water if you’re hopping straight from the shower like a terry cloth would. Since it’s a shorter length, those looking for more length might not like the knee-high cut, but we found it actually to provide ample coverage without discomfort or a lack of warmth. The sizing also runs true to size and is available in up to 4X, servicing many different body types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Modal, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-runner-up-the-mark-bathrobes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton, Runner-Up</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Mark Bathrobes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Mark Bathrobes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GEsAv5GbRfZTKCvf5MxBGs-2j3U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Mark-Bathrobes-c5cdf8875afd4ebf8526721a649036ee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Mark</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The chic, black piping and monogram details.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sleeves were found to be short on some, and the length too long on others — so doesn’t work for all body types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Want to channel your inner Eloise from the comfort of your own home? Ok, so this is not from The Plaza, but we garner that your childhood dreams will come true in The Mark’s bathrobe. Located on the Upper East Side, The Mark Hotel is one of New York’s premiere travel experiences and even city residents can only dream of a staycation at this five-star property. Their signature robe is something to be envied — perhaps you have seen a celebrity post of a selfie featuring the custom piping and “M” logo — and truly gives us all the feels of a luxurious stay without even setting foot in a suite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from 100 percent Egyptian cotton, you’ll be bathed in grandeur, with the soft outside and cozy, towel-textured interior. Two different belt loops are sewn into the seams, allowing you to play with where you prefer to tie the sash. Some favor placement at the waist while some favor it at the stomach — but the choice is yours. When tested, wrinkles and discoloration proved no match for countless wears and washes. Overall, we would happily tuck our hands into the large pockets, cozy up with a hot cup of coffee, and dream of a far-off destination in this classic bathrobe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Egyptian cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>OS<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-men-ugg-mens-robinson-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Men</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Robinson Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Men's Robinson Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/01tAjzKihNhmls9ypAuiRqXANPk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ugg-Robinson-Robe-2ceb794ccf7548609b91956fc9cc83b1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's made using responsibly sourced cotton.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>No hood in the design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ugg might be known for their street style-approved boots and slippers that regularly create an extensive waitlist, but their cozy loungewear should not be overlooked. The brand’s Robinson Robe is a shawl collar silhouette that has a jersey fabric on the outside, with a contrasting fleece lining on the inside. The cotton-blend material is made with responsibly sourced cotton, and this garment is produced in a factory that supports the empowerment and education of women in the workplace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both soft and comfortable, you will instantly feel relaxed upon wearing. We put this robe to the test by wearing it after a shower, throughout the house, and even to sleep in, and it proved to be of great quality that held up to extensive wear and washing. Additionally, it doesn’t retain odor, nor does it produce any excess lint or shedding either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the fleece is on the warmer side, we do not recommend it for very hot environments, but overall, you will be hard-pressed to get us out of this robe. We appreciate the roomy fit, oversized pockets for phone and remote holding, and easy, self-tie belt. It has a stylish look that feels on the high-end side, without being restrictive or too delicate in quality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS/S–XL/XXL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-new-moms-ugg-womens-marlow-robe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for New Moms</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Marlow Robe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Women's Marlow Robe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tRRmLUYRXtcY8TgbLqjyFaf5mG8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/UGGMarlowRobe-994d1cd0afe54b3ba475c590caee95d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The soft, plush fabrication.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is some discrepancy with the sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-118 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are an expectant mother or just had a baby (and even those who are not and just looking for something comfortable), Ugg’s Marlow Robe is a great choice. The robe is what you would expect from an Ugg product — super plush and warm. The relaxed fit leaves plenty of wiggle room for gains during pregnancy, and we believe it will still work size-wise even after giving birth. It’s a long-sleeved silhouette that falls to the floor, hitting at ankle-length for most. Comfort is key during this period, and the Marlow delivers, without restrictions of form-fitting smugness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-119 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether worn with or without clothes underneath, the soft fabric does not irritate the skin. You probably won’t reach for this option on a hot summer day, unless you are in air conditioning, but overall it’s a good weight that will transcend many seasons and climates. As we have discussed in length, plush materials are not the most absorbent, so you will probably want to dry yourself before wearing this robe. Still, it held up to the test by retaining its original quality after multiple washes and wears and didn’t leave any sort of fuzz or lint behind on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3X<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-plus-size-peridot-robes-cuddle-hoodie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Peridot Robes Cuddle Hoodie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Peridot Robes Cuddle Hoodie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NJBniaafsVqx5kEY-sS8Ee0KN94=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Peridot-Robes-Cuddle-Hoodie-125301951537437ab482d01746f30ccc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Peridot Robes</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The expansive size range.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Styles sell out really fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-123 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A good robe is worth investing in — as a big girl because most robes don’t fit us,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>La’Shaunae Steward</a>, curve model and designer, tells InStyle. “I have been on sets at shoots where we are given a robe, and they almost never fit me. Peridot Robes are the most size-inclusive robes I've ever witnessed,” she recommends. The brand focuses on impeccable construction for those sizes 1X–7X and as the name might suggest, the line is robe-heavy. Their Cuddle Hoodie is one of our favorites from the line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-124 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like your favorite sweatshirt, this hoodie style is made from a cotton blend that is soft and breathable. The hem length is longer on the leg for ample coverage and a simple, tie-waist completes the silhouette. Pockets are also included in the design. The cotton-blend fabric is soft inside, but not overwhelmingly heavy, so you can wear it year-round. Currently available in three colorways, take your pick from a heathered black, deep olive, and even an indigo tie-dye that is super cuddly. This is a brilliant first piece from the brand if you are looking to invest in something new.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also love that these robes are handmade in Los Angeles and cut and sewn to order.

Steward always looks for size-inclusivity. “I only care about oversized robes or size up robes from my usual size because robes are meant to be comfortable,” she says. “A good robe needs better sizing, [and to not be] tight in areas where bodies are usually different, like the arms and waist.”</li><li><strong>Fabric: </strong>“The most important function of a robe is warmth and comfort, so I prioritize this above all else,” says Maia James, founder of non-toxic product review site Gimme the Good Stuff. “Depending on the season, where you live, and whether you run hot or cold will determine the best fabric for you, but my favorite robes are made of light, soft, cotton.” Altman appreciates the different weights for the seasons as well. “I love light, crisp cotton for summer, as much as a heavier, fleece fabric for winter,” she explains. However, for all-year wear, she recommends cotton muslin. “It keeps you cool and warm when you need it, plus muslin always feels soft, you don't need to break it in to feel cozy,” she notes. Steward also pays attention to the fabric. Her personal favorites include mohair and cotton jersey for the ultimate in comfort.</li><li><strong>Ethical Responsibility:</strong> “If possible, the robe you buy should have a low impact on the health of the planet and be made in a socially responsible production facility,” James says. “Whenever possible, I prioritize brands that use organic cotton to make their robes, or that have other ethical fashion certifications, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">B Corp</a>.” Steward recommends buying from small brands that cut and sew themselves. “There is just more love that goes into it,” she says.</li><li><strong>Price: </strong>“Price is important to most people when robe shopping because it can be a significant investment, especially if you're looking for a high-quality robe,” James says. “But you do not need to spend a ton of money to buy a really great robe — in fact, most of my favorites are less than $100.” Altman agrees that you don't need to spend a fortune on a good robe, but good fabrics do cost. She likes to view investing in one with a cost-per-wear mindset. “You'll likely be wearing this robe for [five years or more], so spending over $100 is not a bad idea since you'll get a lot of use out of this piece,” Altman says. She also reminds us that robes make the best gifts since they are easy to fit and forgiving, so she recommends telling your family which robe you’d appreciate most for a giftable moment.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered<br></span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What makes a robe great?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A great robe [feels] like a little indulgence every time you reach for it,” says James. “The best robes provide the right amount of warmth for the season, but they won't be bulky and get in the way when you want to make your coffee or wash your face or whatever else you need to do while wearing it.” Often, the best robes are all about the way they make you feel. “A robe has to really envelop you and make you feel comforted, like a big hug,” Altman says. “I know a robe is good if my daughter tries taking it from me — all the good ones end up in her bathroom.” Steward prioritizes comfort and features when classifying a great robe. “Robes that have lots of space and pockets are my favorite, as a big girl who is always carrying tons of stuff around my house back and forth 24/7,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you recommend caring for robes?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If your robe is a quality fabric, it should be easy to care for,” Altman explains. “The best robes are pre-shrunk so you can put it in the washer and the dryer.” She notes that if your robe is a delicate fabric — like silk or satin — skip the dryer, which breaks down the fabric. “Sturdy cottons are easy. Treat them like a towel,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">James’ approach is a little less delicate. “I am sure there are special ways you can or should wash and dry your robes, but honestly, I just toss them in the washer and dryer — and they've held up fine.” She explains that robes are supposed to be easy and comfortable and having to care for a robe in some special way would defeat the purpose. Steward believes that washing is a personal preference, but she does mention she air dries.
