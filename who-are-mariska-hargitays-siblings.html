Keep reading to meet each of them.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Hargitay family is one of Hollywood’s prestigious entertainment families. Both parents were regarded as icons in their respective fields, etching the Hargitay name in the walls of history.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Mariska_Hargitay></span>Who Is Mariska Hargitay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Mariska Hargitay</a> is one of the Hargitay children who is a renowned actress in the entertainment industry. She was born on January 23, 1964, in Santa Monica, California, to parents Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/141944949_3457128374391728_44575151209304041_n.jpg><p>The celebrity daughter is best known for her role as Olivia Benson in one of the most famous drama series ever, “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” Her role as Olivia Benson is one of the longest-running roles in Hollywood, as she has played the character since 1999.&nbsp;</p><p>Mariska made her acting debut in 1985 in the horror comedy “Ghoulies.” Since then, she has graced our screens with many top-notch performances and solidified her status as a Hollywood prodigy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Mariska_Hargitay_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Mariska Hargitay Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “Jocks” actress comes from a family of eight and has five siblings. All six children are different in their own way and have impressive careers. Most of them followed their parents’ footsteps, while some didn’t.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mariska_Hargitays_Brothers_and_Sisters></span>Mariska Hargitay’s Brothers and Sisters<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Hargitay children consist of a unique blend of males and females. These include three brothers and three sisters. Therefore, Mariska has two brothers and three beautiful sisters.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Mariska_Hargitays_Siblings></span>Who Are Mariska Hargitay’s Siblings?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariska Hargitay’s <a href=#>five siblings</a>, in order of their birth dates, are Tina Hargitay, Jayne Marie Mansfield, Mickey Hargitay Jr, Zoltan Hargitay, and the youngest, Tony Cimber.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-13.jpg><p>Each sibling has their own unique story, so let’s meet them.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tina_Hargitay></span>Tina Hargitay&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tina is the eldest sibling of the pack and the first daughter of the Hargitay family. She was born in 1949 and is 74 years old as of 2023. However, Tina is not Jayne Mansfield’s biological daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>She is the daughter of Mickey Hargitay and his first wife, Mary Birge, making her a half-sibling to Mariska. Due to their fantastic family bond, it is impossible to tell that Tina is half-siblings with the rest of her siblings. They are all very close and spend a lot of good time together.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jayne_Marie_Mansfield></span>Jayne Marie Mansfield<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jayne is another sister in the clan who is half-siblings with the rest of them. She was born on November 8, 1950, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, and is a former actress and model.&nbsp;</p><p>She is 73 years old as of 2023 and is the daughter of Jayne Mansfield and her ex-husband, Paul Mansfield. Jayne is prominently known as the first daughter of a playmate (her mom) to be a featured model in 1976.&nbsp;</p><p>Her stunning looks and aura also earned her a spot in the exclusive 100 Beautiful Women once again beside her mother in Playboy magazine’s 1988 special issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Her most memorable acting appearance was in a movie called “Oxen Free.” Jayne was named after her mother and was able to attend her mother’s funeral after she died in a tragic car accident in 1967. She was the oldest of the kids and was the only one strong enough to understand what had happened.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mickey_Hargitay_Jr></span>Mickey Hargitay Jr.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mickey was the first-born son of the family, and this made his parents name him after his father, Mickey Hargitay Snr. He was born on December 21, 1958, and is also in the entertainment industry as an actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Not much is known about him, but various sources say that he started his acting career when he was only a young child of four. Now, he is entirely in the entertainment business and features alongside his siblings on various TV shows.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zoltan_Hargitay></span>Zoltan Hargitay<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zoltan was born on August 1, 1960, and is the second son of the family. He was born in Santa Monica, California, and is 63 as of 2023. Like his siblings and parents, he is involved in the entertainment industry, but not in the way you’d expect.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoltan is a prominent carpenter who has worked on the sets of movies such as “Retroactive,” “T-Force,” “Reflections on a Crime,” and “Shrunken Heads.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/136109349_2790391294604583_8958716054202025037_n.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tony_Cimber></span>Tony Cimber<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tony Cimber is the last child of the Hargitay dynasty and was born on October 18, 1965, in Los Angeles, California. As expected, he is also into showbiz and is an actor, producer, and director in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of Tony’s credits projects include “The Original Ladies of Wrestling” and “Houses of Mystery: Mysteries of the Cathedrals.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Mariska_Hargitays_Mom></span>What Happened to Mariska Hargitay’s Mom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mariska’s mother, Jayne, sadly passed away after a very tragic car accident. The accident, which claimed her life, also had some of her children, Mariska, Mickey Jr., and Zoltan, in it.</p><p>The children walked away with minor injuries, but sadly, Jayne’s life was not spared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jJqpnmWdlr%2Bqv8qaZKGZopy2ta3YrGSsoZKhtq%2Bz0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-mariska-hargitays-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-mariska-hargitays-siblings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-mariska-hargitays-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-mariska-hargitays-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-mariska-hargitays-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-mariska-hargitays-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./matt-gutman-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./matt-gutman-wife.html>Who is Matt Gutman Married to?
