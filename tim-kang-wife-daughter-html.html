As discussed earlier, not much is really known about their wedding or how their romance or love life began.</p><p>Because of the fact that the details, such as their wedding date or venue, still remain a mystery, many even find it hard to believe they are a married pair. But they actually are married, and Gina is Kang's wife.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>It's simply that the two like to maintain their personal life with privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about his wife's details, she&nbsp;was born in 1974 in the USA and had some acting credits to her name in movies such as 'Undressed'&nbsp;and 'Direct Contact.'&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, Gina seems to have taken a step back from her acting career and appears to be focusing more on some other ventures.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Both of them were seen together in 'The Mentalist,' so maybe that was the start of their love life, or perhaps that was just another chapter to their&nbsp;eternal love, well, nobody knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All we can do is admire the two whenever they are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spotted together</a> and admire how adorable the two look together.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Tim Kang with His Wife During an Event </strong>(Source Twitter)</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Tim has also appeared in shows like 'The Vampire Diaries,' 'Criminal Minds,' 'American Horror Story: Cult,'&nbsp;and many more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Keep Looking:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Insight Friends Actress Paget Brewster Married Life, Meet Her Husband</a></p><p>Despite being busy with his career, he, as a parent, gives all of his attention to his daughter.</p><p>In 2011, he came forward to talk about the issue of child's safety and shared how as a parent, one would do anything possible to "protect their children" and "keep them safe." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a dad of a one-year-old daughter, I am more aware than ever before of the dangers that children face. &nbsp;I understand how parents want to do anything possible to protect their children and keep them safe.</p><p>He said. "Parents need to understand that spending a few minutes teaching their children about safety could literally mean the difference between life and death."&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Tim further <a href=# rel="follow noopener">added</a>,&nbsp;"They also need to know about the great resources that are available from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. &nbsp;For example, the&nbsp;Know the Rules&nbsp;series of safety tips is a great tool for parents to review with their children." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Right here are the words of a doting father, and undoubtedly Tim's daughter has to be the luckiest to have Tim Kang as the loving and caring father figure in her life.</p><p>Well, aren't we all? Make sure to say thank you to your parent's peeps! They really do a whole lot for us.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jq2gpmWblruoedainZ5llJbCqLTTnqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftim-kang-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftim-kang-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftim-kang-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftim-kang-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftim-kang-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftim-kang-wife-daughter-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./33-facts-about-the-movie-mission-impossible-rogue-nation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./33-facts-about-the-movie-mission-impossible-rogue-nation.html>33 Facts about the movie Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./top-gun-costumes.html>Original &amp;amp; Reboot Outfit Inspo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./top-gun-costumes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
