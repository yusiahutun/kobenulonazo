If the serum contains silicone, it means it is a smoothening agent that will also eventually make the hair shiny. On the other hand, ingredients like avocado oil, argan oil, and coconut oils are known to provide your hair with the much-needed moisturization that your hair has been looking for.</p><p><strong>b) Haircare Requirements - </strong>Before you pick the product, be clear with your requirements. If you want something to use as a heat protector, pick a formula that provides thermal protection. If you want something that will hold the hair for long, pick a formula that helps you to maintain the style. Similarly, a formula that adds shine and tames frizz will be a lifesaver for dull and dry hair.</p><p><strong>c) Longevity- </strong>If you have curly or wavy hair, and want a sleek and smooth mane, you need to check the longevity of the product or how much the product can hold the style. And that’s where balanced consistency plays a major role. A well-balanced formula, not too thick, not too thin, is excellent for maintaining the hairstyle for the longest possible time.</p><p>Now that you have checked how to pick the products, take a look at how you can use the product effectively—</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use the Best Hair Straightening Serums?</h2></p><p>Here’s how you can—</p><p>a) First thing first — start with clean hair and shampoo the strands thoroughly to ensure nothing is left on the shaft.</p><p>b) Next, take up your conditioner and apply it thoroughly over the shaft so that it remains moisturized throughout even after cleansing.</p><p>c) At this point, you can skip the conditioner and take a hair masque as well and leave it for about half an hour to ensure intense hydration.</p><p>d) After washing off thoroughly, take your microfiber towel, squeeze the excess water from your hair, wrap it around your hair, and leave it for a few minutes to soak the excess water.</p><p>e) Now, you can take your serum and apply it thoroughly over the strands, and keep it as a leave-in product.</p><p>f) Or, you can blow dry your hair followed by straightening to lock the moisture and ensure frizz-free sleek hair all day long.</p><p>g) Lastly, don’t forget to apply a few drops of serums along the length to lock everything in!</p><p>Ta-da!
