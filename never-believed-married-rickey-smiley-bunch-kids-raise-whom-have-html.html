But in the case of Rickey Smiley he has accepted the natural and modern form of being a father.</p><p>Smiley is the father of ten children. Two of the children&nbsp;Brandon Smiley and son Malik Smiley are his biological children, but the remaining children are stated to be&nbsp;adopted from his nieces and nephew.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Source</a>,&nbsp;uptownmagazine.com on June 18, 2014, reports the comedian to be a divorced man who has been looking after his two biological children. However, Smiley has not disclosed any piece of information regarding his wife and separation from her.</p><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Rickey Smiley with his&nbsp;children&nbsp;Brandon Smiley,&nbsp;Malik Smiley and D'Essence (2015).&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: uptownmagazine.com <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Two years ago Rickey gave the shocking news to his audience by revealing the fact of his fatherhood. When providing the full disclosure of taking such initiation of adoption, Smiley reveals the dark secret of his life which he had faced at the age of seven. As published by uptownmagazine.com on&nbsp;June 18, 2014, he said,</p><p>“ I enjoy being best father I can be and being an awesome father to the fatherless. My dad was murdered and taken away from me when I was 7, so I know what it’s like growing up without a father even though I had an awesome granddad and uncles. But to be able to fill that void for somebody else is just incredible. I would actually pay money to do it.”</p><p>On an interview in a show The Real Daytime on&nbsp;March 16, 2015, Smiley further elaborated about his fatherhood experiences along with his childhood memories.</p><p><strong>Caption: Rickey Smiley reveals about being a father of ten children as on posted on YouTube (March 16, 2015).&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Similarly, he was rumored to be dating his co-star Claudia Jourdan from his morning show “The Rickey Smiley Morning Show.” &nbsp;But, the rumor was stashed aside when in the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> series</a> of Real Chat aired on March 16, 2016, straight away stated he is single and has no intention of getting involved with any of the co-workers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p></p><p><strong>Caption: Smiley informs about&nbsp;Claudia Jordan on &nbsp;March 16, 2015.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Well, the stand-up comedian is currently single and has no girlfriend, but like he has kept his married life under the&nbsp;shadow, there is a high chance for the man, to be keeping his dating life behind the curtain as well.</p><p>Being a father of ten children is not a joke, one must be mentally&nbsp;and physically prepared for every consequence&nbsp;and must equally give them time and personal care. Maybe due to this reason he has not been able to find a better partner for himself or maybe the divorce issue might have killed the faith in marriage. Well, nothing can be said till Smiley himself reveals what is going inside his mind.</p><h2>Alleged To Be Gay, How True Can It Be?</h2><p>On the show of “ Rickey Smiley morning show,” Rickey had pulled out the tangled love life of Paula Cook, the American Idol winner.

Though it was a strong accusation made upon the stand-up comedian, he has remained wordless to it. But when looking at his previous record of marriage, he seems to be a straight orientation as he has two children of his own from the marriage, although no details got released by Smiley, he is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> to be straight and single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Multi-talented Star, How Much Is His Net Worth?&nbsp;</h2><p>From the year 2000, stand up comedian Smiley worked in the field of entertainment at the season of BET’s “Comic view” program.&nbsp;Since then he has appeared in many shows of HBO, i.e., Showtime at the Apollo, Def Comedy Jam, Uptown Comedy Club and Snaps.</p><p>He became famous after his famous Prank Calls and continued to work as a Radio Jockey, actor, and&nbsp;a show host.
