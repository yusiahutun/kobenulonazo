But the material magic of this transit is about more than just money, though—you’ll also have an opportunity to connect with your physical body in a deeper and more pleasurable way now. Treat yourself to some five-star restaurants, fine wines, or somatic healing experiences. Just make sure you don’t splurge on too many unnecessary and opulent purchases.
